<h1>The Complete Lojban Language</h1>
<p>The Logical Language Group, Inc. takes great pride in announcing the publication of <a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+Complete+Lojban+Language"><cite>The Complete Lojban Language</cite></a>, by <a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=John+Woldemar+Cowan">John Woldemar Cowan</a>. ISBN 0-9660283-0-9.</p>
<p><cite>The Complete Lojban Language</cite> is a complete description of the artificial language <a href="http://www.lojban.org">Lojban</a>. It serves as a reference grammar for the language, offering an overview of the language, as well as linguistic details on every aspect of the language. This book serves as the standard defining the language design. That design has been declared frozen for a minimum five year period; anyone who learns the language from this book can be assured that it will not be continually changing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+Lojban+Reference+Grammar">An online draft version</a> is available. A list of <a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=CLL%2C+aka+Reference+Grammar%2C+Errata">Errata</a> is also available, most of which have been approved by the book's author.</p>
<p>Though this description may sound imposing, technical and formal, the book is written in a light, often humorous style that teaches the reader about the Lojban language, about logic, and about linguistics in general.</p>
<p>Lojban is a current version of Loglan, the artificial language project described in the June 1960 Scientific American article of that name. "Loglan" was also referred to by name in Robert Heinlein's classic novel The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, as well as in other novels.</p>
<p>Loglan/Lojban is a language designed for several purposes, including linguistics research (especially involving a proposed test of the Sapir/Whorf hypothesis), foreign language instruction, artificial intelligence research, machine translation and related human/computer interaction applications, and as a stimulating educational and entertaining mental exercise. Some people are interested in Lojban as a prospective international auxiliary language. An international community of aficionados has appeared, writing in and about the language, primarily on the Internet.</p>

      <h2>1. What is Lojban?</h2>

      <p>Lojban (pronounced ``LOZH-bahn'') is a constructed language. Previous versions
      of the language were called ``Loglan'' by Dr. James Cooke Brown, who founded the
      Loglan Project and started the development of the language in 1955. The goals for
      the language were first described in the open literature in the article ``Loglan'',
      published in <cite>Scientific American</cite>, June, 1960. Made well-known by that
      article and by occasional references in science fiction (most notably in Robert
      Heinlein's novel <cite>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</cite> and computer
      publications, Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of
      workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical Language Group
      (who are the publishers of this book).</p>

      <p>There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the
      best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique in several
      ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each other, and
        possibly in the future with computers.</li>

        <li>Lojban is designed to be neutral between cultures.</li>

        <li>Lojban grammar is based on the principles of predicate logic.</li>

        <li>Lojban has an unambiguous yet flexible grammar.</li>

        <li>Lojban has phonetic spelling, and unambiguously resolves its sounds into
        words.</li>

        <li>Lojban is simple compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn.</li>

        <li>Lojban's 1300 root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of
        millions of words.</li>

        <li>Lojban is regular; the rules of the language are without exceptions.</li>

        <li>Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and clear thought and
        communication.</li>

        <li>Lojban has a variety of uses, ranging from the creative to the scientific,
        from the theoretical to the practical.</li>

        <li>Lojban has been demonstrated in translation and in original works of prose
        and poetry.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. What is this book?</h2>

      <p>This book is what is called a ``reference grammar''. It attempts to expound the
      whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is understood at present.
      Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been made to
      discover the functions of those features. The word ``discover'' is used advisedly;
      Lojban was not ``invented'' by any one person or committee. Often, grammatical
      features were introduced into the language long before their usage was fully
      understood. Sometimes they were introduced for one reason, only to prove more
      useful for other reasons not recognized at the time.</p>

      <p>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in explanation. For
      every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in <a href="chapter21.html">Chapter
      21</a>), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in the book, and
      often a great deal more than a bit. In essence, <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter
      2</a> gives a brief overview of the language, <a href="chapter21.html">Chapter
      21</a> gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in between put
      semantic bones on that formal flesh. I hope that eventually more grammatical
      material founded on (or even correcting) the explanations in this book will become
      available.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the completion of a
      long period of language evolution. With the exception of a possible revision of the
      language that will not even be considered until five years from publication date,
      and any revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language
      described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its creators any
      more. Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary ---
      Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a fully usable
      language of the modern world, as <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a> explains
      --- and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?)
      native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!) You can learn the language
      described here with assurance that (unlike previous versions of Lojban and Loglan,
      as well as most other artificial languages) it will not be subject to further
      fiddling by language-meisters.</p>

      <p>It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat piecemeal.
      Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific Lojban topic; only later
      did these begin to clump together into a larger structure of words and ideas.
      Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there should be.
      However, I have attempted to make the index as comprehensive as possible.</p>

      <p>Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on words; this
      is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable. The title of <a href=
      "chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a> (which you are now reading), for example, is an
      allusion to the book <cite>English As We Speak It In Ireland</cite>, by P. W.
      Joyce, which is sort of informal reference work about Hiberno-English.
      ``Lojbanistan'' is both an imaginary country where Lojban is the native language,
      and a term for the actual community of Lojban-speakers, scattered over the world.
      Why ``mangle''? As yet, nobody in the real Lojbanistan speaks the language at all
      well, by the standards of the imaginary Lojbanistan; that is one of the
      circumstances this book is meant to help remedy.</p>

      <h2>3. What are the typographical conventions of this book?</h2>

      <p>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a mixture
      of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.</p>

      <p>The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used throughout the
      book. One chapter after another rings the changes on the self-same sentences:</p>
      <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-1-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.
    I go to the store.
</a>
</pre>

      <p>will become wearisomely familiar before <a href="chapter21.html">Chapter 21</a>
      is reached. This method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually)
      familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new grammatical points with
      new vocabulary. Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is
      not a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its predecessors).
      Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of course, at present would-be
      Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and to serve as a reference in the usual
      sense, for looking up obscure points about the language.</p>

      <p>It is useful to talk further about <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> for what it
      illustrates about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The
      first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal translation of
      the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial English. The second and third
      lines are sometimes called the ``literal translation'' and the ``colloquial
      translation'' respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one
      or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it generally means
      that they have the same meaning.</p>

      <p>Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts, these
      enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context of the particular
      example) be either omitted or included. In literal translations, they enclose words
      that are used as conventional translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have
      exactly the meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In <a href=
      "chapter3.html">Chapter 3</a>, square brackets surround phonetic representations in
      the International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>

      <p>Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various sections, are
      in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words discussed in that section;
      the second column contains the grammatical category (represented by an UPPER CASE
      Lojban word) to which the word belongs, and the third column contains a brief
      English gloss, not necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are
      explained in context.</p>

      <p>A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of these are
      explained in <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a>, except for a few used only in
      single chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those
      chapters.</p>

      <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>

      <p>It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do not refer
      to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any such resemblance is
      entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not intended to give offense.</p>

      <p>When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of lujvo, are
      given in this book, they may differ from those given in the English-Lojban
      dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet published). If so, the
      information given in the dictionary supersedes whatever is given here.</p>

      <h2>5. Acknowledgements and Credits</h2>

      <p>Although the bulk of this book was written for the Logical Language Group (LLG)
      by John Cowan, who is represented by the occasional authorial ``I'', certain
      chapters were first written by others and then heavily edited by me to fit into
      this book.</p>

      <p>In particular: <a href="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a> is a fusion of originally
      separate documents, one by Athelstan, and one by Nora Tansky LeChevalier and Bob
      LeChevalier; <a href="chapter3.html">Chapters 3</a> and <a href=
      "chapter4.html">4</a> were originally written by Bob LeChevalier with contributions
      by Chuck Barton; <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a> was originally written (in
      much longer form) by Nick Nicholas; the dialogue near the end of <a href=
      "chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a> was contributed by Nora Tansky LeChevalier;
      <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a> and parts of <a href=
      "chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a> were originally by Bob LeChevalier; and the YACC
      grammar in <a href="chapter21.html">Chapter 21</a> is the work of several hands,
      but is primarily by Bob LeChevalier and Jeff Taylor. The BNF grammar, which is also
      in <a href="chapter21.html">Chapter 21</a>, was originally written by me, then
      rewritten by Clark Nelson, and finally touched up by me again.</p>

      <p>The research into natural languages from which parts of <a href=
      "chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a> draw their material was performed by Ivan Derzhanski.
      LLG acknowledges his kind permission to use the fruits of his research.</p>

      <p>The pictures in this book were drawn by Nora Tansky LeChevalier, except for the
      picture appearing in <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>, which is by Sylvia
      Rutiser.</p>

      <p>I would like to thank the following people for their detailed reviews,
      suggestions, comments, and early detection of my embarrassing errors in Lojban,
      logic, English, and cross-references: Nick Nicholas, Mark Shoulson, Veijo Vilva,
      Colin Fine, And Rosta, Jorge Llambias, Iain Alexander, Paulo S. L. M. Barreto,
      Robert J. Chassell, Ivan Derzhanski, Jim Carter, Irene Gates, Bob LeChevalier, John
      Parks-Clifford (also known as ``pc''), and Nora Tansky LeChevalier.</p>

      <p>Nick Nicholas (NSN) would like to thank the following Lojbanists: Mark Shoulson,
      Veijo Vilva, Colin Fine, And Rosta, and Iain Alexander for their suggestions and
      comments; John Cowan, for his extensive comments, his exemplary trailblazing of
      Lojban grammar, and for solving the ``manskapi'' dilemma for NSN; Jorge Llambias,
      for his even more extensive comments, and for forcing NSN to think more than he was
      inclined to; Bob LeChevalier, for his skeptical overview of the issue, his
      encouragement, and for scouring all Lojban text his computer has been burdened with
      for lujvo; Nora Tansky LeChevalier, for writing the program converting old rafsi
      text to new rafsi text, and sparing NSN from embarrassing errors; and Jim Carter,
      for his dogged persistence in analyzing lujvo algorithmically, which inspired this
      research, and for first identifying the three lujvo classes.</p>

      <p>Of course, the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James Cooke
      Brown as the language inventor, and also to several earlier contributors to the
      development of the language. Especially noteworthy are Doug Landauer, Jeff
      Prothero, Scott Layson, Jeff Taylor, and Bob McIvor. Final responsibility for the
      remaining errors and infelicities is solely mine.</p>

      <h2>6. Informal Bibliography</h2>

      <p>The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is one of the
      products, is <cite>Loglan 1: A Logical Language</cite> by James Cooke Brown (4th
      ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A.) The language
      described therein is not Lojban, but is very close to it and may be considered an
      ancestral version. It is regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book
      has been approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is
      disapproved of by him.</p>

      <p>The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American philosopher
      W. v.O. Quine, especially <cite>Word and Object</cite> (1960, M.I.T. Press). Much
      of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on observation sentences, reads like
      a literal translation from Lojban.</p>

      <p>The theory of negation expounded in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a> is
      derived from a reading of Larry Horn's work <cite>The Natural History of
      Negation</cite>.</p>

      <p>Of course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for the
      uses or misuses I have made of their works.</p>

      <p>Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three other books
      about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English dictionary, and a book
      containing general information about Lojban. You can probably get these books, if
      they have been published, from the same place where you got this book. In addition,
      other books not yet foreseen may also exist.</p>

      <h2>7. Captions to Pictures</h2>

      <p>The following examples list the Lojban caption, with a translation, for the
      picture at the head of each chapter. If a chapter's picture has no caption,
      ``(none)'' is specified instead.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s1" name="s1">1. The concept of the bridi</a></h2>

    <p>This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The
    most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic
    components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in
    this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a ``quick
    tour'' of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also
    introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</p>

    <p>Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John is the father of Sam.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>   John hits Sam.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>   John is taller than Sam.
</pre>These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in
English, we use the noun ``father'' to describe a static relationship in <a href="#e1d1">
    Example 1.1</a> , the verb ``hits'' to describe an active relationship in <a href=
    "#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> , and the adjective ``taller'' to describe an attributive
    relationship in <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a> . In Lojban we make no such
    grammatical distinctions; these three sentences, when expressed in Lojban, are
    structurally identical. The same part of speech is used to represent the
    relationship. In formal logic this whole structure is called a ``predication''; in
    Lojban it is called a ``bridi'', and the central part of speech is the ``selbri''.
    Logicians refer to the things thus related as arguments, while Lojbanists call them
    ``sumti''. These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the book.
    <pre>
         bridi (predicate)
    ______________|________________
    |                              |
    John     is the father of       Sam
    |____|   |______________|      |___|
       |              |              |
    sumti      selbri          sumti (argument)
</pre>In a relationship, there are a definite number of things being related. In English,
for example, ``give'' has three places: the donor, the recipient and the gift. For
example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  John gives Sam the book.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  Sam gives John the book.
</pre>mean two different things because the relative positions of ``John'' and ``Sam''
have been switched.

    <p>Further,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>  The book gives John Sam.
</pre>seems strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox
arguments. The relationship expressed by ``give'' has not changed.

    <p>In Lojban, each selbri has a specified number and type of arguments, known
    collectively as its ``place structure''. The simplest kind of selbri consists of a
    single root word, called a ``gismu'', and the definition in a dictionary gives the
    place structure explicitly. The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence, after
    choosing the relationship itself, is deciding what you will use to fill in the sumti
    places.</p>

    <p>This book uses the Lojban terms ``bridi'', ``sumti'', and ``selbri'', because it
    is best to come to understand them independently of the English associations of the
    corresponding words, which are only roughly similar in meaning anyhow.</p>

    <p>The Lojban examples in this chapter (but not in the rest of the book) use a single
    underline (---) under each sumti, and a double underline (===) under each selbri, to
    help you to tell them apart.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s2" name="s2">2. Pronunciation</a></h2>

    <p>Detailed pronunciation and spelling rules are given in <a href=
    "chapter3.html">Chapter 3</a> , but what follows will keep the reader from going too
    far astray while digesting this chapter.</p>

    <p>Lojban has six recognized vowels: ``a'', ``e'', ``i'', ``o'', ``u'' and ``y''. The
    first five are roughly pronounced as ``a'' as in ``father'', ``e'' as in ``let'',
    ``i'' as in ``machine'', ``o'' as in ``dome'' and ``u'' as in ``flute''. ``y'' is
    pronounced as the sound called ``schwa'', that is, as the unstressed ``a'' as in
    ``about'' or ``around''.</p>

    <p>Twelve consonants in Lojban are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are
    in English: ``b'', ``d'', ``f'', ``k'', ``l'', ``m'', ``n'', ``p'', ``r'', ``t'',
    ``v'' and ``z''. The letter ``c'', on the other hand is pronounced as the ``sh'' in
    ``hush'', while ``j'' is its voiced counterpart, the sound of the ``s'' in
    ``pleasure''. ``g'' is always pronounced as it is in ``gift'', never as in ``giant''.
    ``s'' is as in ``sell'', never as in ``rose''. The sound of ``x'' is not found in
    English in normal words. It is found as ``ch'' in Scottish ``loch'', as ``j'' in
    Spanish ``junta'', and as ``ch'' in German ``Bach''; it also appears in the English
    interjection ``yecchh!''. It gets easier to say as you practice it. The letter ``r''
    can be trilled, but doesn't have to be.</p>

    <p>The Lojban diphthongs ``ai'', ``ei'', ``oi'', and ``au'' are pronounced much as in
    the English words ``sigh'', ``say'', ``boy'', and ``how''. Other Lojban diphthongs
    begin with an ``i'' pronounced like English ``y'' (for example, ``io'' is pronounced
    ``yo'') or else with a ``u'' pronounced like English ``w'' (for example, ``ua'' is
    pronounced ``wa'').</p>

    <p>Lojban also has three ``semi-letters'': the period, the comma and the apostrophe.
    The period represents a glottal stop or a pause; it is a required stoppage of the
    flow of air in the speech stream. The apostrophe sounds just like the English letter
    ``h''. Unlike a regular consonant, it is not found at the beginning or end of a word,
    nor is it found adjacent to a consonant; it is only found between two vowels. The
    comma has no sound associated with it, and is used to separate syllables that might
    ordinarily run together. It is not used in this chapter.</p>

    <p>Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words, unless that vowel is
    ``y'', which is never stressed; in such words the third-to-last syllable is stressed.
    If a word only has one syllable, then that syllable is not stressed.</p>

    <p>All Lojban words are pronounced as they are spelled: there are no silent
    letters.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s3" name="s3">3. Words that can act as sumti</a></h2>

    <p>Here is a short table of single words used as sumti. This table provides examples
    only, not the entire set of such words, which may be found in <a href=
    "chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a> .</p>
    <pre>
   mi  I/me, we/us
    do  you
    ti  this, these
    ta  that, those
    tu  that far away, those far away
    zo'e    unspecified value (used when a sumti is
            unimportant or obvious)
</pre>

    <p>Lojban sumti are not specific as to number (singular or plural), nor gender
    (masculine/feminine/neutral). Such distinctions can be optionally added by methods
    that are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``ti'', ``ta'', and ``tu'' refer to whatever the speaker is pointing at,
    and should not be used to refer to things that cannot in principle be pointed at.</p>

    <p>Names may also be used as sumti, provided they are preceded with the word
    ``la'':</p>
    <pre>
   la meris.   the one/ones named Mary
    la djan.    the one/ones named John
</pre>

    <p>Other Lojban spelling versions are possible for names from other languages, and
    there are restrictions on which letters may appear in Lojban names: see <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s4" name="s4">4. Some words used to indicate selbri relations</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s4" name="s4">Here is a short table of some words used as Lojban selbri in
    this chapter:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s4" name="s4">   vecnu   x1 (seller) sells x2 (goods) to x3 (buyer)
            for x4 (price)
    tavla   x1 (talker) talks to x2 (audience)
            about x3 (topic) in language x4
    sutra   x1 (agent) is fast at doing x2 (action)
    blari'o x1 (object/light source) is blue-green
    melbi   x1 (object/idea) is beautiful to x2 (observer)
            by standard x3
    cutci   x1 is a shoe/boot for x2 (foot)
            made of x3 (material)
    bajra   x1 runs on x2 (surface) using x3 (limbs)
            in manner x4 (gait)
    klama   x1 goes/comes to x2 (destination) from
            x3 (origin point) via x4 (route)
            using x5 (means of transportation)
    pluka   x1 pleases/is pleasing to x2 (experiencer)

    gerku   x1 is a dog of breed x2
    kurji   x1 takes care of x2
    kanro   x1 is healthy by standard x2
    stali   x1 stays/remains with x2
    zarci   x1 is a market/store/shop selling x2 (products)
            operated by x3 (storekeeper)
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s4" name="s4">Each selbri (relation) has a specific rule that defines the
role of each sumti in the bridi, based on its position. In the table above, that order
was expressed by labeling the sumti positions as x1, x2, x3, and x4.</a>

    <p>Like the table in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a> , this table is far from complete:
    in fact, no complete table can exist, because Lojban allows new words to be created
    (in specified ways) whenever a speaker or writer finds the existing supply of words
    inadequate. This notion is a basic difference between Lojban (and some other
    languages such as German and Chinese) and English; in English, most people are very
    leery of using words that ``aren't in the dictionary''. Lojbanists are encouraged to
    invent new words; doing so is a major way of participating in the development of the
    language. <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a> explains how to make new words, and
    <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a> explains how to give them appropriate
    meanings.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s5" name="s5">5. Some simple Lojban bridi</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s5" name="s5">Let's look at a simple Lojban bridi. The place structure of
    the gismu ``tavla'' is</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s5" name="s5"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d1" name=
"e5d1">5.1)</a>  x1 talks to x2 about x3 in language
x4
</pre>where the ``x''es with following numbers represent the various arguments that could
be inserted at the given positions in the English sentence. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  John talks to Sam about engineering
in Lojban.
</pre>has ``John'' in the x1 place, ``Sam'' in the x2 place, ``engineering'' in the x3
place, and ``Lojban'' in the x4 place, and could be paraphrased:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  Talking is going on,
        with speaker John
        and listener Sam
        and subject matter engineering
        and language Lojban.
</pre>

    <p>The Lojban bridi corresponding to <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> will have the
    form</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  x1 [cu] tavla x2 x3 x4
    --      ===== -- -- --
</pre>The word ``cu'' serves as a separator between any preceding sumti and the selbri.
It can often be omitted, as in the following examples.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  mi tavla do zo'e zo'e
    -- ===== -- ---- ----
    I talk to you about something in some language.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>   do tavla mi ta zo'e
    -- ===== -- -- ----
    You talk to me about that thing in a language.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>   mi tavla zo'e tu ti
    -- ===== ---- -- --
    I talk to someone about that thing yonder
        in this language.
</pre>( <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a> is a bit unusual, as there is no easy way to
point to a language; one might point to a copy of this book, and hope the meaning gets
across!)

    <p>When there are one or more occurrences of the cmavo ``zo'e'' at the end of a
    bridi, they may be omitted, a process called ``ellipsis''. <a href="#e5d5">Example
    5.5</a> and <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a> may be expressed thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  mi tavla do
    -- ===== --
    I talk to you (about something in some language).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>   do tavla mi ta
    -- ===== -- --
    You talk to me about that thing (in some language).
</pre>

    <p>Note that <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a> is not subject to ellipsis by this
    direct method, as the ``zo'e'' in it is not at the end of the bridi.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s6" name="s6">6. Variant bridi structure</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s6" name="s6">Consider the sentence</a></p>

    I sell this-thing/these-things to that-buyer/those-buyers.
    (The price is obvious or unimportant.)
</pre><a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> has one sumti (the x1) before the selbri. It is
also possible to put more than one sumti before the selbri, without changing the order of
sumti:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  mi        ti           [cu] vecnu ta

    seller-x1 goods-sold-x2     sells buyer-x3
    I         this              sell  to that.
    (translates as stilted or poetic English)
    I this thing do sell to that buyer.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>   mi        ti            ta

    I         this          to-that       sell.
    (translates as stilted or poetic English)
    I this thing to that buyer do sell.
</pre><a href="#e6d1">Examples 6.1</a> through <a href="#e6d3">6.3</a> mean the same
thing. Usually, placing more than one sumti before the selbri is done for style or for
emphasis on the sumti that are out-of-place from their normal position. (Native speakers
of languages other than English may prefer such orders.)

    <p>If there are no sumti before the selbri, then it is understood that the x1 sumti
    value is equivalent to ``zo'e''; i.e. unimportant or obvious, and therefore not
    given. Any sumti after the selbri start counting from x2.</p>

        (to someone by some standard)
    That/Those         is/are beautiful.
    That is beautiful.
    Those are beautiful.
</pre>when the x1 is omitted, becomes:

    -------------- =====
    unspecified-x1 is-beautiful
        (to someone by some standard)
    Beautiful!
    It's beautiful!
</pre>

    <p>Omitting the x1 adds emphasis to the selbri relation, which has become first in
    the sentence. This kind of sentence is termed an observative, because it is often
    used when someone first observes or takes note of the relationship, and wishes to
    quickly communicate it to someone else. Commonly understood English observatives
    include ``Smoke!'' upon seeing smoke or smelling the odor, or ``Car!'' to a person
    crossing the street who might be in danger. Any Lojban selbri can be used as an
    observative if no sumti appear before the selbri.</p>

    <p>The word ``cu'' does not occur in an observative; ``cu'' is a separator, and there
    must be a sumti before the selbri that needs to be kept separate for ``cu'' to be
    used. With no sumti preceding the selbri, ``cu'' is not permitted. Short words like
    ``cu'' which serve grammatical functions are called ``cmavo'' in Lojban.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s7" name="s7">7. Varying the order of sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s7" name="s7">For one reason or another you may want to change the order,
    placing one particular sumti at the front of the bridi. The cmavo ``se'', when placed
    before the last word of the selbri, will switch the meanings of the first and second
    sumti places. So</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s7" name="s7"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi tavla do ti
    -- ===== -- --
    I talk to you about this.
</pre>has the same meaning as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  do se tavla mi ti
    -- ======== -- --
    You are talked to by me about this.
</pre>The cmavo ``te'', when used in the same location, switches the meanings of the
first and the third sumti places.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  mi tavla do ti
    -- ===== -- --
    I talk to you about this.
</pre>has the same meaning as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  ti te tavla do mi
    -- ======== -- --
    This is talked about to you by me.
</pre>

    <p>Note that only the first and third sumti have switched places; the second sumti
    has remained in the second place.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``ve'' and ``xe'' switch the first and fourth sumti places, and the
    first and fifth sumti places, respectively. These changes in the order of places are
    known as ``conversions'', and the ``se'', ``te'', ``ve'', and ``xe'' cmavo are said
    to convert the selbri.</p>

    <p>More than one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time, and in
    such a case they are evaluated from left to right. However, in practice they are used
    one at a time, as there are better tools for complex manipulation of the sumti
    places. See <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a> for details.</p>

    <p>The effect is similar to what in English is called the ``passive voice''. In
    Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect
    the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination
    with other constructs such as ``le selbri [ku]'' (see <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>
    ).</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s8" name="s8">8. The basic structure of longer utterances</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s8" name="s8">People don't always say just one sentence. Lojban has a
    specific structure for talk or writing that is longer than one sentence. The entirety
    of a given speech event or written text is called an utterance. The sentences
    (usually, but not always, bridi) in an utterance are separated by the cmavo ``ni'o''
    and ``.i''. These correspond to a brief pause (or nothing at all) in spoken English,
    and the various punctuation marks like period, question mark, and exclamation mark in
    written English. These separators prevent the sumti at the beginning of the next
    sentence from being mistaken for a trailing sumti of the previous sentence.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s8" name="s8">The cmavo ``ni'o'' separates paragraphs (covering different
    topics of discussion). In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text
    may be indicated by multiple ``ni'o''s, with perhaps ``ni'oni'oni'o'' used to
    indicate a chapter, ``ni'oni'o'' to indicate a section, and a single ``ni'o'' to
    indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s8" name="s8">The cmavo ``.i'' separates sentences. It is sometimes
    compounded with words that modify the exact meaning (the semantics) of the sentence

    "#s1">Section 1</a> .7, is one such word --- it turns the sentence from a statement
    to a question about truth.) When more than one person is talking, a new speaker will
    usually omit the ``.i'' even though she/he may be continuing on the same topic.</p>

    <p>It is still O.K. for a new speaker to say the ``.i'' before continuing; indeed, it
    is encouraged for maximum clarity (since it is possible that the second speaker might
    merely be adding words onto the end of the first speaker's sentence). A good
    translation for ``.i'' is the ``and'' used in run-on sentences when people are
    talking informally: ``I did this, and then I did that, and ..., and ...''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s9" name="s9">9. tanru</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s9" name="s9">When two gismu are adjacent, the first one modifies the
    second, and the selbri takes its place structure from the rightmost word. Such
    combinations of gismu are called ``tanru''. For example,</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  sutra tavla

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  x1 is a fast type-of talker to x2
about x3
        in language x4
    x1 talks fast to x2 about x3 in language x4
</pre>When three or more gismu are in a row, the first modifies the second, and that
combined meaning modifies the third, and that combined meaning modifies the fourth, and
so on. For example
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  sutra tavla cutci
</pre>has the place structure
    <pre>

        worn by s2 of material s3
</pre>

    <p>That is, it is a shoe that is worn by a fast talker rather than a shoe that is
    fast and is also worn by a talker.</p>

    <p>Note especially the use of ``type-of'' as a mechanism for connecting the English
    translations of the two or more gismu; this convention helps the learner understand
    each tanru in its context. Creative interpretations are also possible, however:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  bajra cutci
    runner shoe
</pre>most probably refers to shoes suitable for runners, but might be interpreted in
some imaginative instances as ``shoes that run (by themselves?)''. In general, however,
the meaning of a tanru is determined by the literal meaning of its components, and not by
any connotations or figurative meanings. Thus
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  sutra tavla
    fast-talker
</pre>would not necessarily imply any trickery or deception, unlike the English idiom,
and a
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  jikca toldi
    social butterfly
</pre>must always be an insect with large brightly-colored wings, of the family
<i>Lepidoptera</i> .

    <p>The place structure of a tanru is always that of the final component of the tanru.
    Thus, the following has the place structure of ``klama'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi [cu] sutra klama la meris.
    --      =========== ---------
    I quickly-go to Mary.
</pre>With the conversion ``se klama'' as the final component of the tanru, the place
structure of the entire selbri is that of ``se klama'': the x1 place is the destination,
and the x2 place is the one who goes:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  mi [cu] sutra se klama la meris.
    --      ============== ---------
    I quickly am-gone-to by Mary.
</pre>The following example shows that there is more to conversion than merely switching
places, though:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>    la tam. [cu] melbi tavla la
meris.
    -------      =========== ---------
    Tom beautifully-talks to Mary.
    Tom is a beautiful-talker to Mary.
</pre>has the place structure of ``tavla'', but note the two distinct interpretations.

    <p>Now, using conversion, we can modify the place structure order:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d11" name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    la meris. [cu] melbi se tavla
la tam.
    ---------      ============== -------
    Mary is beautifully-talked-to by Tom.
    Mary is a beautiful-audience for Tom.
</pre>and we see that the modification has been changed so as to focus on Mary's role in
the bridi relationship, leading to a different set of possible interpretations.

    <p>Note that there is no place structure change if the modifying term is converted,
    and so less drastic variation in possible meanings:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d12" name="e9d12">9.12)</a>    la tam. [cu] tavla melbi la
meris.
    -------      =========== ---------
    Tom is talkerly-beautiful to Mary.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e9d13" name="e9d13">9.13)</a> la tam. [cu] se tavla melbi la
meris.
    -------      ============== ---------
    Tom is audiencely-beautiful to Mary.
</pre>and we see that the manner in which Tom is seen as beautiful by Mary changes, but
Tom is still the one perceived as beautiful, and Mary, the observer of beauty.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s10" name="s10">10. Description sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s10" name="s10">Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker,
    the listener and things we can point to. Let's say I want to talk about a talker
    other than ``mi''. What I want to talk about would naturally fit into the first place
    of ``tavla''. Lojban, it turns out, has an operator that pulls this first place out
    of a selbri and converts it to a sumti called a ``description sumti''. The
    description sumti ``le tavla ku'' means ``the talker'', and may be used wherever any
    sumti may be used.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s10" name="s10">For example,</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s10" name="s10"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d1" name=
"e10d1">10.1)</a>    mi tavla do le tavla ku
    -- ===== -- -----------
</pre>means the same as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    I talk to you about the talker
</pre>where ``the talker'' is presumably someone other than me, though not necessarily.

    <p>Similarly ``le sutra tavla ku'' is ``the fast talker'', and ``le sutra te tavla
    ku'' is ``the fast subject of talk'' or ``the subject of fast talk''. Which of these
    related meanings is understood will depend on the context in which the expression is
    used. The most plausible interpretation within the context will generally be assumed
    by a listener to be the intended one.</p>

    <p>In many cases the word ``ku'' may be omitted. In particular, it is never necessary
    in a description at the end of a sentence, so:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    mi tavla   do  le tavla ku
    -- =====   --  -----------
    I  talk-to you about-the talker
</pre>means exactly the same thing as <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> .

    <p>There is a problem when we want to say ``The fast one is talking.'' The
    ``obvious'' translation ``le sutra tavla'' turns out to mean ``the fast talker'', and
    has no selbri at all. To solve this problem we can use the word ``cu'', which so far
    has always been optional, in front of the selbri.</p>

    <p>The word ``cu'' has no meaning, and exists only to mark the beginning of the
    selbri within the bridi, separating it from a previous sumti. It comes before any
    other part of the selbri, including other cmavo like ``se'' or ``te''. Thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    le sutra tavla
    --------------
    The fast talker

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a> le sutra cu tavla
    --------    =====
    The fast one is talking.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a> le sutra se tavla
    -----------------
    The fast talked-to one

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a> le sutra cu se tavla
    --------    ========
    The fast one is talked to.
</pre>Consider the following more complex example, with two description sumti.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    mi [cu] tavla   le vecnu [ku]
le blari'o [ku]
    --      =====   ------------- ---------------
    I       talk-to the seller    about the blue-green-thing.
</pre>

    <p>The sumti ``le vecnu'' contains the selbri ``vecnu'', which has the ``seller'' in
    the x1 place, and uses it in this sentence to describe a particular ``seller'' that
    the speaker has in mind (one that he or she probably expects the listener will also
    know about). Similarly, the speaker has a particular blue-green thing in mind, which
    is described using ``le'' to mark ``blari'o'', a selbri whose first sumti is
    something blue-green.</p>

    <p>It is safe to omit both occurrences of ``ku'' in <a href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a>
    , and it is also safe to omit the ``cu''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s11" name="s11">11. Examples of brivla</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s11" name="s11">The simplest form of selbri is an individual word. A word
    which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a ``brivla''. The three types

    other languages). All have identical grammatical uses. So far, most of our selbri

selbri. The most commonly used of these is ``go'i'', which represents the main bridi of
the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being
expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. Thus, in this context:

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s13" name="s13">13. Possession</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s13" name="s13">``Possession'' refers to the concept of specifying an
    object by saying who it belongs to (or with). A full explanation of Lojban possession
    is given in</a> <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a> . A simple means of expressing
    possession, however, is to place a sumti representing the possessor of an object
    within the description sumti that refers to the object: specifically, between the
    ``le'' and the selbri of the description:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    le mi gerku cu sutra
    -----------    =====
    The of-me dog is fast.
    My dog is fast.
</pre>In Lojban, possession doesn't necessarily mean ownership: one may ``possess'' a
chair simply by sitting on it, even though it actually belongs to someone else. English
uses possession casually in the same way, but also uses it to refer to actual ownership
or even more intimate relationships: ``my arm'' doesn't mean ``some arm I own'' but
rather ``the arm that is part of my body''. Lojban has methods of specifying all these
different kinds of possession precisely and easily.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s14" name="s14">14. Vocatives and commands</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s14" name="s14">You may call someone's attention to the fact that you are

</pre>means ``Oh, John, I'm talking to you''. It also has the effect of setting the value
of ``do''; ``do'' now refers to ``John'' until it is changed in some way in the
conversation. Note that <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> is not a bridi, but it is a
legitimate Lojban sentence nevertheless; it is known as a ``vocative phrase''.

    <p>Other cmavo can be used instead of ``doi'' in a vocative phrase, with a different
    significance. For example, the cmavo ``coi'' means ``hello'' and ``co'o'' means
    ``good-bye''. Either word may stand alone, they may follow one another, or either may
    be followed by a pause and a name. (Vocative phrases with ``doi'' do not need a pause
    before the name.)</p>

</pre>Commands are expressed in Lojban by a simple variation of the main bridi structure.
If you say

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e14d4" name="e14d4">14.4)</a>    do tavla
    -- =====
    You are-talking.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e14d5" name="e14d5">14.5)</a>    ko tavla
    -- =====
</pre>instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make <a href="#e14d4">Example
14.4</a> true; it means ``Talk!'' Other examples:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e14d6" name="e14d6">14.6)</a>    ko sutra
    -- =====
    Be fast!
</pre>

    <p>The ``ko'' need not be in the x1 place, but rather can occur anywhere a sumti is
    allowed, leading to possible Lojban commands that are very unlike English
    commands:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e14d7" name="e14d7">14.7)</a>    mi tavla ko
    -- ===== --

colloquially, ``Take care of yourself''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s15" name="s15">15. Questions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s15" name="s15">There are many kinds of questions in Lojban: full
    explanations appear in</a> <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a> and in various
    other chapters throughout the book. In this chapter, we will introduce three kinds:
    sumti questions, selbri questions, and yes/no questions.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``ma'' is used to create a sumti question: it indicates that the speaker
    wishes to know the sumti which should be placed at the location of the ``ma'' to make
    the bridi true. It can be translated as ``Who?'' or ``What?'' in most cases, but also
    serves for ``When?'', ``Where?'', and ``Why?'' when used in sumti places that express
    time, location, or cause. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d1" name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    ma   tavla do     mi
    --   ===== --     --
    Who? talks to-you about-me.
    Who is talking to you about me?
</pre>

    <p>The listener can reply by simply stating a sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    la djan.
    --------
    John (is talking to you about me).
</pre>

    <p>Like ``ko'', ``ma'' can occur in any position where a sumti is allowed, not just
    in the first position:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    do [cu] tavla   ma
    --      =====   --
    You     talk to what/whom?
</pre>

    <p>A ``ma'' can also appear in multiple sumti positions in one sentence, in effect
    asking several questions at once.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d4" name="e15d4">15.4)</a>    ma [cu]  tavla    ma
    --       =====    --
    What/Who talks to what/whom?
</pre>The two separate ``ma'' positions ask two separate questions, and can therefore be
answered with different values in each sumti place.

    <p>The cmavo ``mo'' is the selbri analogue of ``ma''. It asks the respondent to
    provide a selbri that would be a true relation if inserted in place of the
    ``mo'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d5" name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    do [cu] mo
    --      ==
    You are-what/do-what?
</pre>

    <p>A ``mo'' may be used anywhere a brivla or other selbri might. Keep this in mind
    for later examples. Unfortunately, by itself, ``mo'' is a very non-specific question.
    The response to the question in <a href="#e15d5">Example 15.5</a> could be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d6" name="e15d6">15.6)</a>    mi [cu] melbi
    --      =====
    I am beautiful.
</pre>or:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a>    mi [cu] tavla
    --      =====
    I talk.
</pre>Clearly, ``mo'' requires some cooperation between the speaker and the respondent to
ensure that the right question is being answered. If context doesn't make the question
specific enough, the speaker must ask the question more specifically using a more complex
construction such as a tanru (see <a href="#s9">Section 9</a> ).

    <p>It is perfectly permissible for the respondent to fill in other unspecified places
    in responding to a ``mo'' question. Thus, the respondent in <a href="#e15d7">Example
    15.7</a> could have also specified an audience, a topic, and/or a language in the
    response.</p>

    <p>Finally, we must consider questions that can be answered ``Yes'' or ``No'', such
    as</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d8" name="e15d8">15.8)</a>    Are you talking to me?
</pre>

    <p>Like all yes-or-no questions in English, <a href="#e15d8">Example 15.8</a> may be
    reformulated as</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d9" name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    Is it true that you are talking
to me?
</pre>In Lojban we have a word that asks precisely that question in precisely the same
way. The cmavo ``xu'', when placed in front of a bridi, asks whether that bridi is true
as stated. So
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d10" name="e15d10">15.10)</a>  xu              do  tavla     
 mi
                    --  =====       --
    Is-it-true-that you are-talking to-me?
</pre>is the Lojban translation of <a href="#e15d8">Example 15.8</a> .

    <p>The answer ``Yes'' may be given by simply restating the bridi without the ``xu''
    question word. Lojban has a shorthand for doing this with the word ``go'i'',
    mentioned in <a href="#s11">Section 11</a> . Instead of a negative answer, the bridi
    may be restated in such a way as to make it true. If this can be done by substituting
    sumti, it may be done with ``go'i'' as well. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d11" name="e15d11">15.11)</a>  xu do kanro
       -- =====
    Are you healthy?
</pre>can be answered with
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d12" name="e15d12">15.12)</a>  mi kanro
    -- =====
    I am healthy.
</pre>or
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d13" name="e15d13">15.13)</a>  go'i
    ====
    I am healthy.
</pre>(Note that ``do'' to the questioner is ``mi'' to the respondent.)

    <p>or</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d14" name="e15d14">15.14)</a>  le tavla cu kanro
    --------    =====
    The talker is healthy.
</pre>or
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e15d15" name="e15d15">15.15)</a>  le tavla cu go'i
    --------    ====
    The talker is healthy.
</pre>A general negative answer may be given by ``na go'i''. ``na'' may be placed before
any selbri (but after the ``cu''). It is equivalent to stating ``It is not true that
...'' before the bridi. It does not imply that anything else is true or untrue, only that
that specific bridi is not true. More details on negative statements are available in
<a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a> .

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s16" name="s16">16. Indicators</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s16" name="s16">Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a
    variety of intonations and gestures that are not usually included in written
    language. Some of these are available in some languages as interjections (i.e. Aha!,
    Oh no!, Ouch!, Aahh!, etc.), but they vary greatly from culture to culture.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s16" name="s16">Lojban has a group of cmavo known as ``attitudinal
    indicators'' which specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements.
    They are both written and spoken, but require no specific intonation or gestures.
    Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a
    bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word
    immediately to the left. For example:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s16" name="s16"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s16" name="s16"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    .ie mi [cu] klama
        --      =====
    Agreement! I go.
    Yep! I'll go.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a> .ei mi [cu] klama
        --      =====
    Obligation! I go.
    I should go.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a> mi [cu] klama le melbi .ui [ku]
    --      ===== --------(   )---
    I go to the beautiful-thing
        (and I am happy because it is the beautiful
        thing I'm going to).
</pre>Not all indicators indicate attitudes. Discursives, another group of cmavo with the
same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds
of commentary about the main utterances. Using discursives allows a clear separation of
these so-called ``metalinguistic'' features from the underlying statements and logical
structure. By comparison, the English words ``but'' and ``also'', which discursively
indicate contrast or an added weight of example, are logically equivalent to ``and'',
which does not have a discursive content. The average English-speaker does not think
about, and may not even realize, the paradoxical idea that ``but'' basically means
``and''.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d4" name="e16d4">16.4)</a>    mi [cu] klama .i do [cu] stali
    --      =====    --      =====
    I go.  You stay.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d5" name="e16d5">16.5)</a> mi [cu] klama .i ji'a do [cu]
stali
    --      =====         --      =====
    I go.  In addition, you stay.  (added weight)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d6" name="e16d6">16.6)</a> mi [cu] klama .i ku'i do [cu]
stali
    --      =====         --      =====
    I go.  However, you stay.  (contrast)
</pre>Another group of indicators are called ``evidentials''. Evidentials show the
speaker's relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the
statement. These include ``za'a'' (I directly observe the relationship), ``pe'i'' (I
believe that the relationship holds), ``ru'a'' (I postulate the relationship), and
others. Many American Indian languages use this kind of words.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e16d7" name="e16d7">16.7)</a>    pe'i do [cu] melbi

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s17" name="s17">17. Tenses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s17" name="s17">In English, every verb is tagged for the grammatical
    category called tense: past, present, or future. The sentence</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-s17" name="s17"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d1" name="e17d1">17.1)</a>    John went to the store
</pre>necessarily happens at some time in the past, whereas
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d2" name="e17d2">17.2)</a>    John is going to the store
</pre>is necessarily happening right now.

    <p>The Lojban sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d3" name="e17d3">17.3)</a>    la djan.  [cu] klama         le
zarci
    --------  ==========         --------
    John      goes/went/will   go to-the store
</pre>serves as a translation of either <a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> or <a href=
"#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> , and of many other possible English sentences as well. it is
not marked for tense, and can refer to an event in the past, the present or the future.
This rule does not mean that Lojban has no way of representing the time of an event. A
close translation of <a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> would be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d4" name="e17d4">17.4)</a>    la djan.   pu klama    le zarci
    --------   ========    --------
    John       [past] goes to-the store
</pre>where the tag ``pu'' forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past. Similarly,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d5" name="e17d5">17.5)</a>    la djan.   ca klama       le
zarci
    --------   ========       --------
    John       [present] goes to-the store
</pre>necessarily refers to the present, because of the tag ``ca''. Tags used in this way
always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the ``cu'', and they may
make a ``cu'' unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. Note that
    <a href="#e17d3">Example 17.3</a> has and requires a ``cu'' to prevent ``bajra'' and
    ``klama'' from forming a tanru, but <a href="#e17d4">Example 17.4</a> and <a href=
    "#e17d5">Example 17.5</a> lack the unnecessary ``cu''. Such tags serve as an
    equivalent to English tenses and adverbs. In Lojban, tense information is completely
    optional. If unspecified, the appropriate tense is picked up from context.

    <p>Lojban also extends the notion of ``tense'' to refer not only to time but to
    space. The following example uses the tag ``vu'' to specify that the event it
    describes happens far away from the speaker:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d6" name="e17d6">17.6)</a>    do [cu] vu vecnu    zo'e
    --      ========
    You     yonder sell something-unspecified.
</pre>

    <p>In addition, tense tags (either for time or space) can be prefixed to the selbri
    of a description, producing a tensed sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d7" name="e17d7">17.7)</a>    le pu bajra [ku] cu           
tavla
    ----------------               =====
    The earlier/former/past runner talked/talks.
</pre>(Since Lojban tense is optional, we don't know when he or she talks.)

    <p>Tensed sumti with space tags correspond roughly to the English use of ``this'' or
    ``that'' as adjectives, as in the following example, which uses the tag ``vi''
    meaning ``nearby'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d8" name="e17d8">17.8)</a>    le vi bajra [ku]   cu tavla
    ----------------      =====
    The nearby runner     talks.
    This runner talks.
</pre>

    <p>Do not confuse the use of ``vi'' in <a href="#e17d8">Example 17.8</a> with the
    cmavo ``ti'', which also means ``this'', but in the sense of ``this thing''.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, a tense tag can appear both on the selbri and within a description,
    as in the following example (where ``ba'' is the tag for future time):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-2-e17d9" name="e17d9">17.9)</a>    le vi tavla [ku] cu ba klama
    ----------------    ========
    The here talker     [future] goes.
    The talker who is here will go
    This talker will go.

      The Hills Are Alive With The Sounds Of Lojban</h1><!--

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1">1. Orthography</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1">Lojban is designed so that any properly spoken Lojban
    utterance can be uniquely transcribed in writing, and any properly written Lojban can
    be spoken so as to be uniquely reproduced by another person. As a consequence, the
    standard Lojban orthography must assign to each distinct sound, or phoneme, a unique
    letter or symbol. Each letter or symbol has only one sound or, more accurately, a
    limited range of sounds that are permitted pronunciations for that phoneme. Some
    symbols indicate stress (speech emphasis) and pause, which are also essential to
    Lojban word recognition. In addition, everything that is represented in other
    languages by punctuation (when written) or by tone of voice (when spoken) is
    represented in Lojban by words. These two properties together are known technically
    as ``audio-visual isomorphism''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1">Lojban uses a variant of the Latin (Roman) alphabet,
    consisting of the following letters and symbols:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1">' , . a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p r s t u v x y
      z</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s1" name="s1">omitting the letters ``h'', ``q'', and ``w''.</a>

    <p>The alphabetic order given above is that of the ASCII coded character set, widely
    used in computers. By making Lojban alphabetical order the same as ASCII,
    computerized sorting and searching of Lojban text is facilitated.</p>

    <p>Capital letters are used only to represent non-standard stress, which can appear
    only in the representation of Lojbanized names. Thus the English name ``Josephine'',
    as normally pronounced, is Lojbanized as ``DJOsefin.'', pronounced <span class=
    "c3">[&Egrave;dZo sE fin/]</span>. (See <a href="#s2">Section 2</a> for an
    explanation of the symbols within square brackets.) Technically, it is sufficient to
    capitalize the vowel letter, in this case ``O'', but it is easier on the reader to
    capitalize the whole syllable.</p>

    <p>Without the capitalization, the ordinary rules of Lojban stress would cause the
    ``se'' syllable to be stressed. Lojbanized names are meant to represent the
    pronunciation of names from other languages with as little distortion as may be; as
    such, they are exempt from many of the regular rules of Lojban phonology, as will
    appear in the rest of this chapter.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s2" name="s2">2. Basic Phonetics</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s2" name="s2">Lojban pronunciations are defined using the International
    Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA, a standard method of transcribing pronunciations. By
    convention, IPA transcriptions are always within square brackets: for example, the
    word ``cat'' is pronounced (in General American pronunciation) <span class=
    "c3">[kQt]</span>.</a> <a href="#s10">Section 10</a> contains a brief explanation of
    the IPA characters used in this chapter, with their nearest analogues in English, and
    will be especially useful to those not familiar with the technical terms used in
    describing speech sounds.</p>

    <p>The standard pronunciations and permitted variants of the Lojban letters are
    listed in the table below. The descriptions have deliberately been made a bit
    ambiguous to cover variations in pronunciation by speakers of different native
    languages and dialects. In all cases except ``r'' the first IPA symbol shown
    represents the preferred pronunciation; for ``r'', all of the variations (and any
    other rhotic sound) are equally acceptable.</p>

    z   <span class="c3">[z]</span>        a voiced alveolar sibilant
</pre>The Lojban sounds must be clearly pronounced so that they are not mistaken for each
other. Voicing and placement of the tongue are the key factors in correct pronunciation,
but other subtle differences will develop between consonants in a Lojban-speaking
community. At this point these are the only mandatory rules on the range of sounds.

    <p>Note in particular that Lojban vowels can be pronounced with either rounded or
    unrounded lips; typically ``o'' and ``u'' are rounded and the others are not, as in
    English, but this is not a requirement; some people round ``y'' as well. Lojban
    consonants can be aspirated or unaspirated. Palatalizing of consonants, as found in
    Russian and other languages, is not generally acceptable in pronunciation, though a
    following ``i'' may cause it.</p>

    <p>The sounds represented by the letters ``c'', ``g'', ``j'', ``s'', and ``x''
    require special attention for speakers of English, either because they are ambiguous
    in the orthography of English (``c'', ``g'', ``s''), or because they are strikingly
    different in Lojban (``c'', ``j'', ``x''). The English ``c'' represents three
    different sounds, <span class="c3">[k]</span> in ``cat'' and <span class=
    "c3">[s]</span> in ``cent'', as well as the <span class="c3">[S]</span> of ``ocean''.
    Similarly, English ``g'' can represent <span class="c3">[g]</span> as in ``go'',
    <span class="c3">[dZ]</span> as in ``gentle'', and <span class="c3">[Z]</span> as in
    ``garage'' (in some pronunciations). English ``s'' can be either <span class=
    "c3">[s]</span> as in ``cats'', <span class="c3">[z]</span> as in ``cards'',
    <span class="c3">[S]</span> as in ``tension'', or <span class="c3">[Z]</span> as in
    ``measure''. The sound of Lojban ``x'' doesn't appear in most English dialects at
    all.</p>

    <p>There are two common English sounds that are found in Lojban but are not not
    Lojban consonants: the ``ch'' of ``church'' and the ``j'' of ``judge''. In Lojban,
    these are considered two consonant sounds spoken together without an intervening
    vowel sound, and so are represented in Lojban by the two separate consonants: ``tc''
    (IPA <span class="c3">[tS]</span>) and ``dj'' (IPA <span class="c3">[dZ]</span>). In
    general, whether a complex sound is considered one sound or two depends on the
    language: Russian views ``ts'' as a single sound, whereas English, French, and Lojban
    consider it to be a consonant cluster.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s3" name="s3">3. The Special Lojban Characters</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s3" name="s3">The apostrophe, period, and comma need special attention.
    They are all used as indicators of a division between syllables, but each has a
    different pronunciation, and each is used for different reasons:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s3" name="s3">The apostrophe represents a phoneme similar to a short,
    breathy English ``h'', (IPA <span class="c3">[h]</span>). The letter ``h'' is not
    used to represent this sound for two reasons: primarily in order to simplify
    explanations of the morphology, but also because the sound is very common, and the
    apostrophe is a visually lightweight representation of it. The apostrophe sound is a
    consonant in nature, but is not treated as either a consonant or a vowel for purposes
    of Lojban morphology (word-formation), which is explained in</a> <a href=
    "chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>. In addition, the apostrophe visually parallels the
    comma and the period, which are also used (in different ways) to separate
    syllables.</p>

    <p>The apostrophe is included in Lojban only to enable a smooth separation between
    vowels, while joining the vowels within a single word. In fact, one way to think of
    the apostrophe is as representing a unvoiced vowel glide.</p>

    <p>As a permitted variant, any unvoiced fricative other than those already used in
    Lojban may be used to render the apostrophe: IPA <span class="c3">[T]</span> is one
    possibility. The convenience of the listener should be regarded as paramount in
    deciding to use a substitute for <span class="c3">[h]</span>.</p>

    <p>The period represents a mandatory pause, with no specified length; a glottal stop
    (IPA <span class="c3">[/]</span>) is considered a pause of shortest length. A pause
    (or glottal stop) may appear between any two words, and in certain cases -- explained
    in detail in <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a> --- must occur. In particular, a
    word beginning with a vowel is always preceded by a pause, and a word ending in a
    consonant is always followed by a pause.</p>

    <p>Technically, the period is an optional reminder to the reader of a mandatory pause
    that is dictated by the rules of the language; because these rules are unambiguous, a
    missing period can be inferred from otherwise correct text. Periods are included only
    as an aid to the reader.</p>

    <p>A period also may be found apparently embedded in a word. When this occurs, such a
    written string is not one word but two, written together to indicate that the writer
    intends a unitary meaning for the compound. It is not really necessary to use a space
    between words if a period appears.</p>

    <p>The comma is used to indicate a syllable break within a word, generally one that
    is not obvious to the reader. Such a comma is written to separate syllables, but
    indicates that there must be no pause between them, in contrast to the period.
    Between two vowels, a comma indicates that some type of glide may be necessary to
    avoid a pause that would split the two syllables into separate words. It is always
    legal to use the apostrophe (IPA <span class="c3">[h]</span>) sound in pronouncing a
    comma. However, a comma cannot be pronounced as a pause or glottal stop between the
    two letters separated by the comma, because that pronunciation would split the word
    into two words.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, a comma is usually only used to clarify the presence of syllabic ``l'',
    ``m'', ``n'', or ``r'' (discussed later). Commas are never required: no two Lojban
    words differ solely because of the presence or placement of a comma.</p>

    <p>Here is a somewhat artificial example of the difference in pronunciation between
    periods, commas and apostrophes. In the English song about Old MacDonald's Farm, the
    vowel string which is pronounced ``ee-i-ee-i-o'' in English could be Lojbanized with
    periods as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  .i.ai.i.ai.o
    <span class="c3">[/i /aj /i /aj /o]</span>
    Ee! Eye! Ee! Eye! Oh!
</pre>

    <p>However, this would sound clipped, staccato, and unmusical compared to the
    English. Furthermore, although <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> is a string of
    meaningful Lojban words, as a sentence it makes very little sense. (Note the use of
    periods embedded within the written word.)</p>

    <p>If commas were used instead of periods, we could represent the English string as a
    Lojbanized name, ending in a consonant:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  .i,ai,i,ai,on.
    <span class="c3">[/i jaj ji jaj jon/]</span>
</pre>

    <p>The commas represent new syllable breaks, but prohibit the use of pauses or
    glottal stop. The pronunciation shown is just one possibility, but closely parallels
    the intended English pronunciation.</p>

    <p>However, the use of commas in this way is risky to unambiguous interpretation,
    since the glides might be heard by some listeners as diphthongs, producing something
    like</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  .i,iai,ii,iai,ion.
</pre>which is technically a different Lojban name. Since the intent with Lojbanized
names is to allow them to be pronounced more like their native counterparts, the comma is
allowed to represent vowel glides or some non-Lojbanic sound. Such an exception affects
only spelling accuracy and the ability of a reader to replicate the desired pronunciation
exactly; it will not affect the recognition of word boundaries.

    <p>Still, it is better if Lojbanized names are always distinct. Therefore, the
    apostrophe is preferred in regular Lojbanized names that are not attempting to
    simulate a non-Lojban pronunciation perfectly. (Perfection, in any event, is not
    really achievable, because some sounds simply lack reasonable Lojbanic
    counterparts.)</p>

    <p>If apostrophes were used instead of commas in <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>, it
    would appear as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  .i'ai'i'ai'on.
    <span class="c3">[/i hai hi hai hon/]</span>
</pre>which preserves the rhythm and length, if not the exact sounds, of the original
English.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s4" name="s4">4. Diphthongs and Syllabic Consonants</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s4" name="s4">There exist 16 diphthongs in the Lojban language. A diphthong
    is a vowel sound that consists of two elements, a short vowel sound and a glide,
    either a labial (IPA <span class="c3">[w]</span>) or palatal (IPA <span class=
    "c3">[j]</span>) glide, that either precedes (an on-glide) or follows (an off-glide)
    the main vowel. Diphthongs always constitute a single syllable.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s4" name="s4">For Lojban purposes, a vowel sound is a relatively long
    speech-sound that forms the nucleus of a syllable. Consonant sounds are relatively
    brief and normally require an accompanying vowel sound in order to be audible.
    Consonants may occur at the beginning or end of a syllable, around the vowel, and
    there may be several consonants in a cluster in either position. Each separate vowel
    sound constitutes a distinct syllable; consonant sounds do not affect the
    determination of syllables.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s4" name="s4">The six Lojban vowels are ``a'', ``e'', ``i'', ``o'', ``u'',
    and ``y''. The first five vowels appear freely in all kinds of Lojban words. The
    vowel ``y'' has a limited distribution: it appears only in Lojbanized names, in the
    Lojban names of the letters of the alphabet, as a glue vowel in compound words, and
    standing alone as a space-filler word (like English ``uh'' or ``er'').</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s4" name="s4">The Lojban diphthongs are shown in the table below. (Variant
    pronunciations have been omitted, but are much as one would expect based on the

    used only as stand-alone words and in Lojbanized names and borrowings; and the last
    two (``iy'' and ``uy'') are used only in Lojbanized names.</p>

    <p>The syllabic consonants of Lojban, <span class="c3">[l`]</span>, <span class=

    respectively. They normally have only a limited distribution, appearing in Lojban
    names and borrowings, although in principle any ``l'', ``m'', ``n'', or ``r'' may be
    pronounced syllabically. If a syllabic consonant appears next to a ``l'', ``m'',
    ``n'', or ``r'' that is not syllabic, it may not be clear which is which:</p>

    or <span class="c3">[brl` gan]</span>
</pre>is a hypothetical Lojbanized name with more than one valid pronunciation; however
it is pronounced, it remains the same word.

    <p>Syllabic consonants are treated as consonants rather than vowels from the
    standpoint of Lojban morphology. Thus Lojbanized names, which are generally required
    to end in a consonant, are allowed to end with a syllabic consonant. An example is
    ``rl.'', which is an approximation of the English name ``Earl'', and has two syllabic
    consonants.</p>

    <p>Syllables with syllabic consonants and no vowel are never stressed or counted when

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s5" name="s5">Lojban vowels also occur in pairs, where each vowel sound is
    in a separate syllable. These two vowel sounds are connected (and separated) by an
    apostrophe. Lojban vowel pairs should be pronounced continuously with the
    <span class="c3">[h]</span> sound between (and not by a glottal stop or pause, which
    would split the two vowels into separate words).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s5" name="s5">All vowel combinations are permitted in two-syllable pairs

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s5" name="s5">Vowel pairs involving ``y'' appear only in Lojbanized names.
They could appear in cmavo (structure words), but only ``.y'y.'' is so used --- it is the
Lojban name of the apostrophe letter (see</a> <a href="chapter17.html">Chapter 17</a>).

    <p>When more than two vowels occur together in Lojban, the normal pronunciation pairs
    vowels from the left into syllables, as in the Lojbanized name:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  meiin.
    mei,in.
</pre><a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> contains the diphthong ``ei'' followed by the vowel
``i''. In order to indicate a different grouping, the comma must always be used, leading
to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  me,iin.
</pre>which contains the vowel ``e'' followed by the diphthong ``ii''. In rough English
representation, <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> is ``May Een'', whereas <a href="#e5d2">
    Example 5.2</a> is ``Meh Yeen''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">6. Consonant Clusters</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">A consonant sound is a relatively brief speech-sound that
    precedes or follows a vowel sound in a syllable; its presence either preceding or
    following does not add to the count of syllables, nor is a consonant required in
    either position for any syllable. Lojban has seventeen consonants: for the purposes
    of this section, the apostrophe is not counted as a consonant.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">An important distinction dividing Lojban consonants is that
    of voicing. The following table shows the unvoiced consonants and the corresponding
    voiced ones:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6"></a></p>

    f       v

    x       -
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">The consonant ``x'' has no voiced counterpart in Lojban. The
    remaining consonants, ``l'', ``m'', ``n'', and ``r'', are typically pronounced with
    voice, but can be pronounced unvoiced.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">Consonant sounds occur in languages as single consonants, or
    as doubled, or as clustered combinations. Single consonant sounds are isolated by
    word boundaries or by intervening vowel sounds from other consonant sounds. Doubled
    consonant sounds are either lengthened like <span class="c3">[s]</span> in English
    ``hiss'', or repeated like <span class="c3">[k]</span> in English ``backcourt''.
    Consonant clusters consist of two or more single or doubled consonant sounds in a
    group, each of which is different from its immediate neighbor. In Lojban, doubled
    consonants are excluded altogether, and clusters are limited to two or three members,
    except in Lojbanized names.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">Consonants can occur in three positions in words: initial (at
    the beginning), medial (in the middle), and final (at the end). In many languages,
    the sound of a consonant varies depending upon its position in the word. In Lojban,
    as much as possible, the sound of a consonant is unrelated to its position. In
    particular, the common American English trait of changing a ``t'' between vowels into
    a ``d'' or even a flap (IPA <span class="c3">[&uml;]</span>) is unacceptable in
    Lojban.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s6" name="s6">Lojban imposes no restrictions on the appearance of single

</pre>Note that if both consonants of an initial pair are voiced, the unvoiced equivalent
is also permissible, and the voiced pair can be pronounced simply by voicing the unvoiced
pair. (The converse is not true: ``cn'' is a permissible initial pair, but ``jn'' is
not.)

    <p>Consonant triples can occur medially in Lojban words. They are subject to the
    following rules:</p>

      <dd>The triples ``ndj'', ``ndz'', ``ntc'', and ``nts'' are forbidden.</dd>
    </dl>Lojbanized names can begin or end with any permissible consonant pair, not just
    the 48 initial consonant pairs listed above, and can have consonant triples in any
    location, as long as the pairs making up those triples are permissible. In addition,
    names can contain consonant clusters with more than three consonants, again requiring
    that each pair within the cluster is valid.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s8" name="s8">8. Buffering Of Consonant Clusters</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s8" name="s8">Many languages do not have consonant clusters at all, and
    even those languages that do have them often allow only a subset of the full Lojban
    set. As a result, the Lojban design allows the use of a buffer sound between
    consonant combinations which a speaker finds unpronounceable. This sound may be any
    non-Lojbanic vowel which is clearly separable by the listener from the Lojban vowels.
    Some possibilities are IPA <span class="c3">[I]</span>, <span class=
    "c3">[&ouml;]</span>, <span class="c3">[U]</span>, or even <span class=
    "c3">[Y]</span>, but there probably is no universally acceptable buffer sound. When
    using a consonant buffer, the sound should be made as short as possible. Two examples
    showing such buffering (we will use <span class="c3">[I]</span> in this chapter)
    are:</a></p>

    <span class="c3">[/am ster dam/]</span>
    or <span class="c3">[&Egrave;/a mI sI tE rI da mI/]</span>
</pre>When a buffer vowel is used, it splits each buffered consonant into its own
syllable. However, the buffering syllables are never stressed, and are not counted in
determining stress. They are, in effect, not really syllables to a Lojban listener, and
thus their impact is ignored.

</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a>, we see that buffering vowels can be used in
    just some, rather than all, of the possible places: the second pronunciation buffers
    the ``pc'' consonant pair but not the ``ck''. The third pronunciation buffers
    both.</p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  bongnanba
    <span class="c3">[boN &Egrave;gnan ba]</span>
</pre>a possible borrowing from another language (Lojban borrowings can only take a
limited form). If <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> were pronounced with buffering, as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  <span class="c3">[boN gI &Egrave;nan ba]</span>
</pre>it would be very similar to <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a>. Only a clear
distinction between ``y'' and any buffering vowel would keep the two words distinct.

    <p>Since buffering is done for the benefit of the speaker in order to aid
    pronounceability, there is no guarantee that the listener will not mistake a buffer
    vowel for one of the six regular Lojban vowels. The buffer vowel should be as laxly
    pronounced as possible, as central as possible, and as short as possible.
    Furthermore, it is worthwhile for speakers who use buffers to pronounce their regular
    vowels a bit longer than usual, to avoid confusion with buffer vowels. The speakers
    of many languages will have trouble correctly hearing any of the suggested buffer
    vowels otherwise. By this guideline, <a href="#e8d8">Example 8.8</a> would be

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9">9. Syllabication And Stress</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9">A Lojban word has one syllable for each of its vowels,
    diphthongs, and syllabic consonants (referred to simply as ``vowels'' for the
    purposes of this section.) Syllabication rules determine which of the consonants
    separating two vowels belong to the preceding vowel and which to the following vowel.
    These rules are conventional only; the phonetic facts of the matter about how
    utterances are syllabified in any language are always very complex.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9">A single consonant always belongs to the following vowel. A
    consonant pair is normally divided between the two vowels; however, if the pair
    constitute a valid initial consonant pair, they are normally both assigned to the
    following vowel. A consonant triple is divided between the first and second
    consonants. Apostrophes and commas, of course, also represent syllable breaks.
    Syllabic consonants usually appear alone in their syllables.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9">It is permissible to vary from these rules in Lojbanized
    names. For example, there are no definitive rules for the syllabication of names with
    consonant clusters longer than three consonants. The comma is used to indicate
    variant syllabication or to explicitly mark normal syllabication.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9">Here are some examples of Lojban syllabication:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  pujenaicajeba
    pu,je,nai,ca,je,ba
</pre>

    <p>This word has no consonant pairs and is therefore syllabified before each medial
    consonant.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  ninmu
    nin,mu
</pre>

    <p>This word is split at a consonant pair.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  fitpri
    fit,pri
</pre>

    <p>This word is split at a consonant triple, between the first two consonants of the
    triple.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  sairgoi
    sair,goi
    sai,r,goi
</pre>

    <p>This word contains the consonant pair ``rg''; the ``r'' may be pronounced
    syllabically or not.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  klezba
    klez,ba
    kle,zba
</pre>

    <p>This word contains the permissible initial pair ``zb'', and so may be syllabicated
    either between ``z'' and ``b'' or before ``zb''.</p>

    <p>Stress is a relatively louder pronunciation of one syllable in a word or group of
    words. Since every syllable has a vowel sound (or diphthong or syllabic consonant) as
    its nucleus, and the stress is on the vowel sound itself, the terms ``stressed
    syllable'' and ``stressed vowel'' are largely interchangeable concepts.</p>

    <p>Most Lojban words are stressed on the next-to-the-last, or penultimate, syllable.
    In counting syllables, however, syllables whose vowel is ``y'' or which contain a
    syllabic consonant (``l'', ``m'', ``n'', or ``r'') are never counted. (The Lojban
    term for penultimate stress is ``da'amoi terbasna''.) Similarly, syllables created
    solely by adding a buffer vowel, such as <span class="c3">[I]</span>, are not
    counted.</p>

    <p>There are actually three levels of stress --- primary, secondary, and weak. Weak
    stress is the lowest level, so it really means no stress at all. Weak stress is
    required for syllables containing ``y'', a syllabic consonant, or a buffer vowel.</p>

    <p>Primary stress is required on the penultimate syllable of Lojban content words
    (called ``brivla''). Lojbanized names may be stressed on any syllable, but if a
    syllable other than the penultimate is stressed, the syllable (or at least its vowel)
    must be capitalized in writing. Lojban structural words (called ``cmavo'') may be
    stressed on any syllable or none at all. However, primary stress may not be used in a
    syllable just preceding a brivla, unless a pause divides them; otherwise, the two
    words may run together.</p>

    <p>Secondary stress is the optional and non-distinctive emphasis used for other
    syllables besides those required to have either weak or primary stress. There are few
    rules governing secondary stress, which typically will follow a speaker's native
    language habits or preferences. Secondary stress can be used for contrast, or for
    emphasis of a point. Secondary stress can be emphasized at any level up to primary
    stress, although the speaker must not allow a false primary stress in brivla, since
    errors in word resolution could result.</p>

    <p>The following are Lojban words with stress explicitly shown:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  dikyjvo
    DI,ky,jvo
</pre>(In a fully-buffered dialect, the pronunciation would be: <span class=
"c3">[&Egrave;di k&laquo; jI vo]</span>.) Note that the syllable ``ky'' is not counted in
determining stress. The vowel ``y'' is never stressed in a normal Lojban context.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  .armstrong.
    .ARM,strong.
</pre>

    <p>This is a Lojbanized version of the name ``Armstrong''. The final ``g'' must be
    explicitly pronounced. With full buffering, the name would be pronounced:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  <span class=
"c3">[&Egrave;/a rI mI sI tI ro nI gI/]</span>
</pre>

    <p>However, there is no need to insert a buffer in every possible place just because
    it is inserted in one place: partial buffering is also acceptable. In every case,
    however, the stress remains in the same place: on the first syllable.</p>

    <p>The English pronunciation of ``Armstrong'', as spelled in English, is not correct
    by Lojban standards; the letters ``ng'' in English represent a velar nasal (IPA
    <span class="c3">[N]</span>) which is a single consonant. In Lojban, ``ng''
    represents two separate consonants that must both be pronounced; you may not use
    <span class="c3">[N]</span> to pronounce Lojban ``ng'', although <span class=
    "c3">[Ng]</span> is acceptable. English speakers are likely to have to pronounce the
    ending with a buffer, as one of the following:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  <span class="c3">[&Egrave;/arm stron gI/]</span>
    or <span class="c3">[&Egrave;/arm stroN gI/]</span>
    or even <span class="c3">[&Egrave;/arm stro nIg/]</span>
</pre>

    <p>The normal English pronunciation of the name ``Armstrong'' could be Lojbanized
    as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>    .ARMstron.
</pre>since Lojban ``n'' is allowed to be pronounced as the velar nasal <span class="c3">
    [N]</span>.

    <p>Here is another example showing the use of ``y'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d11" name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    bisydja
    BI,sy,dja
    BI,syd,ja
</pre>

    <p>This word is a compound word, or lujvo, built from the two affixes ``bis'' and
    ``dja''. When they are joined, an impermissible consonant pair results: ``sd''. In
    accordance with the algorithm for making lujvo, explained in <a href=
    "chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>, a ``y'' is inserted to separate the impermissible
    consonant pair; the ``y'' is not counted as a syllable for purposes of stress
    determination.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d12" name="e9d12">9.12)</a>    da'udja
    da'UD,ja
    da'U,dja
</pre>

    <p>These two syllabications sound the same to a Lojban listener --- the association
    of unbuffered consonants in syllables is of no import in recognizing the word.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d13" name="e9d13">9.13)</a>    e'u bridi
    e'u BRI,di
    E'u BRI,di
    e'U.BRI,di
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d13">Example 9.13</a>, ``e'u'' is a cmavo and ``bridi'' is a
    brivla. Either of the first two pronunciations is permitted: no primary stress on
    either syllable of ``e'u'', or primary stress on the first syllable. The third
    pronunciation, which places primary stress on the second syllable of the cmavo,
    requires that --- since the following word is a brivla --- the two words must be
    separated by a pause. Consider the following two cases:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d14" name="e9d14">9.14)</a>    le re nobli prenu
    le re NObli PREnu

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-e9d15" name="e9d15">9.15)</a> le re no bliprenu
    le re no bliPREnu
</pre>

    <p>If the cmavo ``no'' in <a href="#e9d15">Example 9.15</a> were to be stressed, the
    phrase would sound exactly like the given pronunciation of <a href="#e9d14">Example
    9.14</a>, which is unacceptable in Lojban: a single pronunciation cannot represent
    both.</p>

    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-3-s10" name="s10">There also exists a Cyrillic orthography for Lojban which

    ``i'', ``ka'', ``el'', ``em'', ``en'', ``o'', ``pe'', ``er'', ``es'', ``te'', ``u'',
    ``ef'', ``kha'', and ``sha'' in the obvious ways. The Latin letter ``y'' is mapped

    orthography invented by J. R. R. Tolkien and described in the Appendixes to <cite>The
    Lord Of The Rings</cite>, has been devised for Lojban. The following mapping, which
    closely resembles that used for Westron, will be meaningful only to those who have
    read those appendixes. In brief, the tincot&eacute;ma and parmat&eacute;ma are used
    in the conventional ways; the calmat&eacute;ma represents palatal consonants, and the
    quesset&eacute;ma represents velar consonants.</p>

    <p>The letters ``vala'' and ``anna'' are used for ``u'' and ``i'' only when those

    and ``z'' are written with ``r&oacute;men'', ``lambe'', ``silme'', and
    ``&aacute;re/``esse'' respectively; the inverted forms are used as free variants.</p>

    <p>Lojban, like Quenya, is a vowel-last language, so tehtar are read as following the
    tengwar on which they are placed. The conventional tehtar are used for the five
    regular vowels, and the under-dot for ``y''. The Lojban apostrophe is represented by
    ``halla''. There is no equivalent of the Lojban comma or period.</p>

      <h1>Chapter 4<br />
      The Shape Of Words To Come: Lojban Morphology</h1><!--
      <h5>$Revision: 4.1 $<br />
      mkhtml: 1.1</h5>
      -->
    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s1" name="s1">Morphology is the part of grammar that deals with the form of
    words. Lojban's morphology is fairly simple compared to that of many languages,
    because Lojban words don't change form depending on how they are used. English has
    only a small number of such changes compared to languages like Russian, but we do
    have changes like ``boys'' as the plural of ``boy'', or ``walked'' as the past-tense
    form of ``walk''. To make plurals or past tenses in Lojban, you add separate words to
    the sentence that express the number of boys, or the time when the walking was going
    on.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s1" name="s1">However, Lojban does have what is called ``derivational
    morphology'': the capability of building new words from old words. In addition, the
    form of words tells us something about their grammatical uses, and sometimes about
    the means by which they entered the language. Lojban has very orderly rules for the
    formation of words of various types, both the words that already exist and new words
    yet to be created by speakers and writers.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s1" name="s1">A stream of Lojban sounds can be uniquely broken up into its
    component words according to specific rules. These so-called ``morphology rules'' are
    summarized in this chapter. (However, a detailed algorithm for breaking sounds into
    words has not yet been fully debugged, and so is not presented in this book.) First,
    here are some conventions used to talk about groups of Lojban letters, including
    vowels and consonants.</a></p>

    </dl>Lojban has three basic word classes --- parts of speech --- in contrast to the
    eight that are traditional in English. These three classes are called cmavo, brivla,
    and cmene. Each of these classes has uniquely identifying properties --- an
    arrangement of letters that allows the word to be uniquely and unambiguously
    recognized as a separate word in a string of Lojban, upon either reading or hearing,
    and as belonging to a specific word-class.

    <p>They are also functionally different: cmavo are the structure words, corresponding
    to English words like ``and'', ``if'', ``the'' and ``to''; brivla are the content
    words, corresponding to English words like ``come'', ``red'', ``doctor'', and
    ``freely''; cmene are proper names, corresponding to English ``James'',
    ``Afghanistan'', and ``Pope John Paul II''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s2" name="s2">2. cmavo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s2" name="s2">The first group of Lojban words discussed in this chapter are
    the cmavo. They are the structure words that hold the Lojban language together. They
    often have no semantic meaning in themselves, though they may affect the semantics of
    brivla to which they are attached. The cmavo include the equivalent of English
    articles, conjunctions, prepositions, numbers, and punctuation marks. There are over
    a hundred subcategories of cmavo, known as ``selma'o'', each having a specifically
    defined grammatical usage. The various selma'o are discussed throughout</a> <a href=
    "chapter5.html">Chapters 5</a> to <a href="chapter19.html">19</a> and summarized in
    <a href="chapter20.html">Chapter 20</a>.</p>

    <p>Standard cmavo occur in four forms defined by their word structure. Here are some
    examples of the various forms:</p>
    <pre>
   V-form      .a  .e  .i  .o  .u
    CV-form     ba  ce  di  fo  gu
    VV-form     .au .ei .ia .o'u    .u'e
    CVV-form    ki'a    pei mi'o    coi cu'u
</pre>

    <p>In addition, there is the cmavo ``.y.'' (remember that ``y'' is not a V), which
    must have pauses before and after it.</p>

    <p>A simple cmavo thus has the property of having only one or two vowels, or of
    having a single consonant followed by one or two vowels. Words consisting of three or
    more vowels in a row, or a single consonant followed by three or more vowels, are
    also of cmavo form, but are reserved for experimental use: a few examples are
    ``ku'a'e'', ``sau'e'', and ``bai'ai''. All CVV cmavo beginning with the letter ``x''
    are also reserved for experimental use. In general, though, the form of a cmavo tells
    you little or nothing about its grammatical use.</p>

    <p>``Experimental use'' means that the language designers will not assign any
    standard meaning or usage to these words, and words and usages coined by Lojban
    speakers will not appear in official dictionaries for the indefinite future.
    Experimental-use words provide an escape hatch for adding grammatical mechanisms (as
    opposed to semantic concepts) the need for which was not foreseen.</p>

    <p>The cmavo of VV-form include not only the diphthongs and vowel pairs listed in
    <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, but also the following ten additional diphthongs:</p>
    <pre>
   .ia .ie .ii .io .iu
    .ua .ue .ui .uo .uu
</pre>

    <p>In addition, cmavo can have the form ``Cy'', a consonant followed by the letter
    ``y''. These cmavo represent letters of the Lojban alphabet, and are discussed in
    detail in <a href="chapter17.html">Chapter 17</a>.</p>

    <p>Compound cmavo are sequences of cmavo attached together to form a single written
    word. A compound cmavo is always identical in meaning and in grammatical use to the
    separated sequence of simple cmavo from which it is composed. These words are written
    in compound form merely to save visual space, and to ease the reader's burden in
    identifying when the component cmavo are acting together.</p>

    <p>Compound cmavo, while not visually short like their components, can be readily
    identified by two characteristics:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>They have no consonant pairs or clusters, and</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>They end in a vowel.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  .iseci'i
    .i se ci'i

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   punaijecanai
    pu nai je ca nai

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>   ki'e.u'e
    ki'e .u'e
</pre>The cmavo ``.u'e'' begins with a vowel, and like all words beginning with a vowel,
requires a pause (represented by ``.'') before it. This pause cannot be omitted simply
because the cmavo is incorporated into a compound cmavo. On the other hand,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  ki'e'u'e
</pre>is a single cmavo reserved for experimental purposes: it has four vowels.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  cy.ibu.abu
    cy. .ibu .abu
</pre>

    <p>Again the pauses are required (see <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>); the pause after
    ``cy.'' merges with the pause before ``.ibu''.</p>

    <p>There is no particular stress required in cmavo or their compounds. Some
    conventions do exist that are not mandatory. For two-syllable cmavo, for example,
    stress is typically placed on the first vowel; an example is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  .e'o ko ko kurji
    .E'o ko ko KURji
</pre>

    <p>This convention results in a consistent rhythm to the language, since brivla are
    required to have penultimate stress; some find this esthetically pleasing.</p>

    <p>If the final syllable of one word is stressed, and the first syllable of the next
    word is stressed, you must insert a pause or glottal stop between the two stressed
    syllables. Thus</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  le re nanmu
</pre>can be optionally pronounced
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  le RE. NANmu
</pre>since there are no rules forcing stress on either of the first two words; the
stress on ``re'', though, demands that a pause separate ``re'' from the following
syllable ``nan'' to ensure that the stress on ``nan'' is properly heard as a stressed
syllable. The alternative pronunciation
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>  LE re NANmu
</pre>is also valid; this would apply secondary stress (used for purposes of emphasis,
contrast or sentence rhythm) to ``le'', comparable in rhythmical effect to the English
phrase ``THE two men''. In <a href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a>, the secondary stress on
``re'' would be similar to that in the English phrase ``the TWO men''.

    <p>Both cmavo may also be left unstressed, thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e2d10" name="e2d10">2.10)</a>    le re NANmu
</pre>

    <p>This would probably be the most common usage.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">3. brivla</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">Predicate words, called ``brivla'', are at the core of
    Lojban. They carry most of the semantic information in the language. They serve as
    the equivalent of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, all in a single part
    of speech.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">Every brivla belongs to one of three major subtypes. These
    subtypes are defined by the form, or morphology, of the word --- all words of a
    particular structure can be assigned by sight or sound to a particular type (cmavo,
    brivla, or cmene) and subtype. Knowing the type and subtype then gives you, the
    reader or listener, significant clues to the meaning and the origin of the word, even
    if you have never heard the word before.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">The same principle allows you, when speaking or writing, to
    invent new brivla for new concepts ``on the fly''; yet it offers people that you are
    trying to communicate with a good chance to figure out your meaning. In this way,
    Lojban has a flexible vocabulary which can be expanded indefinitely.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">All brivla have the following properties:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">1)</a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">always end in a vowel;</a></dd>

      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">2)</a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3">always contain a consonant pair in the first five letters,
      where ``y'' and apostrophe are not counted as letters for this purpose.
      (See</a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s3" name="s3"></a> <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>.)</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>always are stressed on the next-to-the-last (penultimate) syllable; this
      implies that they have two or more syllables.</dd>
    </dl>The presence of a consonant pair distinguishes brivla from cmavo and their
    compounds. The final vowel distinguishes brivla from cmene, which always end in a
    consonant. Thus ``da'amei'' must be a compound cmavo because it lacks a consonant
    pair; ``lojban.'' must be a name because it lacks a final vowel.

    <p>Thus, ``bisycla'' has the consonant pair ``sc'' in the first five non-``y''
    letters even though the ``sc'' actually appears in the form of ``syc''. Similarly,
    the word ``ro'inre'o'' contains ``nr'' in the first five letters because the
    apostrophes are not counted for this purpose.</p>

    <p>The three subtypes of brivla are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>gismu, the Lojban primitive roots from which all other brivla are built;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>lujvo, the compounds of two or more gismu; and</dd>
    </dl>
    <pre>
3) fu'ivla (literally ``copy-word''), the specialized
    words that are not Lojban primitives or natural
    compounds, and are therefore borrowed from other
    languages.
</pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s4" name="s4">4. gismu</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s4" name="s4">The gismu, or Lojban root words, are those brivla
    representing concepts most basic to the language. The gismu were chosen for various
    reasons: some represent concepts that are very familiar and basic; some represent
    concepts that are frequently used in other languages; some were added because they
    would be helpful in constructing more complex words; some because they represent
    fundamental Lojban concepts (like ``cmavo'' and ``gismu'' themselves).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s4" name="s4">The gismu do not represent any sort of systematic
    partitioning of semantic space. Some gismu may be superfluous, or appear for
    historical reasons: the gismu list was being collected for almost 35 years and was
    only weeded out once. Instead, the intention is that the gismu blanket semantic
    space: they make it possible to talk about the entire range of human
    concerns.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s4" name="s4">There are about 1350 gismu. In learning Lojban, you need only
    to learn most of these gismu and their combining forms (known as ``rafsi'') as well
    as perhaps 200 major cmavo, and you will be able to communicate effectively in the
    language. This may sound like a lot, but it is a small number compared to the
    vocabulary needed for similar communications in other languages.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s4" name="s4">All gismu have very strong form restrictions. Using the
    conventions defined in</a> <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, all gismu are of the forms
    CVC/CV or CCVCV. They must meet the rules for all brivla given in <a href=
    "#s3">Section 3</a>; furthermore, they:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>always have five letters;</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>always start with a consonant and end with a single vowel;</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>always contain exactly one consonant pair, which is a permissible initial pair
      (CC) if it's at the beginning of the gismu, but otherwise only has to be a
      permissible pair (C/C);</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>are always stressed on the first syllable (since that is penultimate).</dd>
    </dl>The five letter length distinguishes gismu from lujvo and fu'ivla. (It is
    possible to have fu'ivla like ``spa'i'' that are five letters long, but they must
    have ``'''; no gismu contains ``'''.)

    <p>With the exception of five special brivla variables, ``broda'', ``brode'',
    ``brodi'', ``brodo'', and ``brodu'', no two gismu differ only in the final vowel.
    Furthermore, the set of gismu was specifically designed to reduce the likelihood that
    two similar sounding gismu could be confused. For example, because ``gismu'' is in
    the set of gismu, ``kismu'', ``xismu'', ``gicmu'', ``gizmu'', and ``gisnu'' cannot
    be.</p>

    <p>Almost all Lojban gismu are constructed from pieces of words drawn from other
    languages, specifically Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic, the
    six most widely spoken natural languages. For a given concept, words in the six
    languages that represent that concept were written in Lojban phonetics. Then a gismu
    was selected to maximize the recognizability of the Lojban word for speakers of the
    six languages by weighting the inclusion of the sounds drawn from each language by
    the number of speakers of that language. See <a href="#s14">Section 14</a> for a full
    explanation of the algorithm.</p>

    <p>Here are a few examples of gismu, with rough English equivalents (not
    definitions):</p>

    <p>A small number of gismu were formed differently; see <a href="#s15">Section 15</a>
    for a list.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s5" name="s5">5. lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s5" name="s5">When specifying a concept that is not found among the gismu
    (or, more specifically, when the relevant gismu seems too general in meaning), a
    Lojbanist generally attempts to express the concept as a tanru. Lojban tanru are an
    elaboration of the concept of ``metaphor'' used in English. In Lojban, any brivla can
    be used to modify another brivla. The first of the pair modifies the second. This
    modification is usually restrictive --- the modifying brivla reduces the broader
    sense of the modified brivla to form a more narrow, concrete, or specific concept.
    Modifying brivla may thus be seen as acting like English adverbs or adjectives. For
    example,</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s5" name="s5"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  skami pilno
</pre>is the tanru which expresses the concept of ``computer user''.

    <p>The simplest Lojban tanru are pairings of two concepts or ideas. Such tanru take
    two simpler ideas that can be represented by gismu and combine them into a single
    more complex idea. Two-part tanru may then be recombined in pairs with other tanru,
    or with individual gismu, to form more complex or more specific ideas, and so on.</p>

    <p>The meaning of a tanru is usually at least partly ambiguous: ``skami pilno'' could
    refer to a computer that is a user, or to a user of computers. There are a variety of
    ways that the modifier component can be related to the modified component. It is also
    possible to use cmavo within tanru to provide variations (or to prevent ambiguities)
    of meaning.</p>

    <p>Making tanru is essentially a poetic or creative act, not a science. While the
    syntax expressing the grouping relationships within tanru is unambiguous, tanru are
    still semantically ambiguous, since the rules defining the relationships between the
    gismu are flexible. The process of devising a new tanru is dealt with in detail in
    <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

    <p>To express a simple tanru, simply say the component gismu together. Thus the
    binary metaphor ``big boat'' becomes the tanru</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  barda bloti
</pre>representing roughly the same concept as the English word ``ship''.

    <p>The binary metaphor ``father mother'' can refer to a paternal grandmother (``a
    father-ly type of mother''), while ``mother father'' can refer to a maternal
    grandfather (``a mother-ly type of father''). In Lojban, these become the tanru</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  patfu mamta
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  mamta patfu
</pre>respectively.

    <p>The possibility of semantic ambiguity can easily be seen in the last case. To
    interpret <a href="#e5d4">Example 5.4</a>, the listener must determine what type of
    motherliness pertains to the father being referred to. In an appropriate context,
    ``mamta patfu'' could mean not ``grandfather'' but simply ``father with some motherly
    attributes'', depending on the culture. If absolute clarity is required, there are
    ways to expand upon and explain the exact interrelationship between the components;
    but such detail is usually not needed.</p>

    <p>When a concept expressed in a tanru proves useful, or is frequently expressed, it
    is desirable to choose one of the possible meanings of the tanru and assign it to a
    new brivla. For <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a>, we would probably choose ``user of
    computers'', and form the new word</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  sampli
</pre>

    <p>Such a brivla, built from the rafsi which represent its component words, is called
    a ``lujvo''. Another example, corresponding to the tanru of <a href="#e5d2">Example
    5.2</a>, would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  bralo'i
    big-boat
    ship
</pre>The lujvo representing a given tanru is built from units representing the component
gismu. These units are called ``rafsi'' in Lojban. Each rafsi represents only one gismu.
The rafsi are attached together in the order of the words in the tanru, occasionally
inserting so-called ``hyphen'' letters to ensure that the pieces stick together as a
single word and cannot accidentally be broken apart into cmavo, gismu, or other word
forms. As a result, each lujvo can be readily and accurately recognized, allowing a
listener to pick out the word from a string of spoken Lojban, and if necessary,
unambiguously decompose the word to a unique source tanru, thus providing a strong clue
to its meaning.

    <p>The lujvo that can be built from the tanru ``mamta patfu'' in <a href=
    "#e5d4">Example 5.4</a> is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  mampa'u
</pre>which refers specifically to the concept ``maternal grandfather''. The two gismu
that constitute the tanru are represented in ``mampa'u'' by the rafsi ``mam-'' and
``-pa'u'', respectively; these two rafsi are then concatenated together to form
``mampa'u''.

    <p>Like gismu, lujvo have only one meaning. When a lujvo is formally entered into a
    dictionary of the language, a specific definition will be assigned based on one
    particular interrelationship between the terms. (See <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter
    12</a> for how this has been done.) Unlike gismu, lujvo may have more than one form.
    This is because there is no difference in meaning between the various rafsi for a
    gismu when they are used to build a lujvo. A long rafsi may be used, especially in
    noisy environments, in place of a short rafsi; the result is considered the same
    lujvo, even though the word is spelled and pronounced differently. Thus the word
    ``brivla'', built from the tanru ``bridi valsi'', is the same lujvo as ``brivalsi'',
    ``bridyvla'', and ``bridyvalsi'', each of which uses a different combination of
    rafsi.</p>

    <p>When assembling rafsi together into lujvo, the rules for valid brivla must be
    followed: a consonant cluster must occur in the first five letters (excluding ``y''
    and ``'''), and the lujvo must end in a vowel.</p>

    <p>A ``y'' (which is ignored in determining stress or consonant clusters) is inserted
    in the middle of the consonant cluster to glue the word together when the resulting
    cluster is either not permissible or the word is likely to break up. There are
    specific rules describing these conditions, detailed in <a href="#s6">Section
    6</a>.</p>

    <p>An ``r'' (in some cases, an ``n'') is inserted when a CVV-form rafsi attaches to
    the beginning of a lujvo in such a way that there is no consonant cluster. For
    example, in the lujvo</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  soirsai
    sonci sanmi
    soldier meal
    field rations
</pre>the rafsi ``soi-'' and ``-sai'' are joined, with the additional ``r'' making up the
``rs'' consonant pair needed to make the word a brivla. Without the ``r'', the word would
break up into ``soi sai'', two cmavo. The pair of cmavo have no relation to their rafsi
lookalikes; they will either be ungrammatical (as in this case), or will express a
different meaning from what was intended.

    <p>Learning rafsi and the rules for assembling them into lujvo is clearly seen to be
    necessary for fully using the potential Lojban vocabulary.</p>

    <p>Most important, it is possible to invent new lujvo while you speak or write in
    order to represent a new or unfamiliar concept, one for which you do not know any
    existing Lojban word. As long as you follow the rules for building these compounds,
    there is a good chance that you will be understood without explanation.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s6" name="s6">6. rafsi</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s6" name="s6">Every gismu has from two to five rafsi, each of a different
    form, but each such rafsi represents only one gismu. It is valid to use any of the
    rafsi forms in building lujvo --- whichever the reader or listener will most easily
    understand, or whichever is most pleasing --- subject to the rules of lujvo making.
    There is a scoring algorithm which is intended to determine which of the possible and
    legal lujvo forms will be the standard dictionary form (see</a> <a href=
    "#s12">Section 12</a>).</p>

    <p>Each gismu always has at least two rafsi forms; one is the gismu itself (used only
    at the end of a lujvo), and one is the gismu without its final vowel (used only at
    the beginning or middle of a lujvo). These forms are represented as -CVC/CV or -CCVCV
    (called ``the 5-letter rafsi''), and -CVC/C- or -CCVC- (called ``the 4-letter
    rafsi'') respectively. The dashes in these rafsi form representations show where
    other rafsi may be attached to form a valid lujvo. When lujvo are formed only from
    4-letter and 5-letter rafsi, known collectively as ``long rafsi'', they are called
    ``unreduced lujvo''.</p>

    <p>Some examples of unreduced lujvo forms are:</p>

    from ``vanci sanmi''
    ``evening meal'' or ``supper''
</pre>In addition to these two forms, each gismu may have up to three additional short
rafsi, three letters long. All short rafsi have one of the forms -CVC-, -CCV-, or -CVV-.
The total number of rafsi forms that are assigned to a gismu depends on how useful the
gismu is, or is presumed to be, in making lujvo, when compared to other gismu that could
be assigned the rafsi.

    <p>For example, ``zmadu'' (``more than'') has the two short rafsi ``-zma-'' and
    ``-mau-'' (in addition to its unreduced rafsi ``-zmad-'' and ``-zmadu''), because a
    vast number of lujvo have been created based on ``zmadu'', corresponding in general
    to English comparative adjectives ending in ``-er'' such as ``whiter'' (Lojban
    ``labmau''). On the other hand, ``bakri'' (``chalk'') has no short rafsi and few
    lujvo.</p>

    <p>There are at most one CVC-form, one CCV-form, and one CVV-form rafsi per gismu. In
    fact, only a tiny handful of gismu have both a CCV-form and a CVV-form rafsi
    assigned, and still fewer have all three forms of short rafsi. However, gismu with
    both a CVC-form and another short rafsi are fairly common, partly because more
    possible CVC-form rafsi exist. Yet CVC-form rafsi, even though they are fairly easy
    to remember, cannot be used at the end of a lujvo (because lujvo must end in vowels),
    so justifying the assignment of an additional short rafsi to many gismu.</p>

    <p>The intention was to use the available ``rafsi space'' --- the set of all possible
    short rafsi forms --- in the most efficient way possible; the goal is to make the
    most-used lujvo as short as possible (thus maximizing the use of short rafsi), while
    keeping the rafsi very recognizable to anyone who knows the source gismu. For this
    reason, the letters in a rafsi have always been chosen from among the five letters of
    the corresponding gismu. As a result, there are a limited set of short rafsi
    available for assignment to each gismu. At most seven possible short rafsi are
    available for consideration (of which at most three can be used, as explained
    above).</p>

    <p>Here are the only short rafsi forms that can possibly exist for gismu of the form
    CVC/CV, like ``sakli''. The digits in the second column represent the gismu letters
    used to form the rafsi.</p>
    <pre>
   CVC     123     -sak-
    CVC     124     -sal-
    CVV     12'5        -sa'i-
    CVV     125     -sai-
    CCV     345     -kli-
    CCV     132     -ska-
</pre>(The only actual short rafsi for ``sakli'' is ``-sal-''.)

    <p>For gismu of the form CCVCV, like ``blaci'', the only short rafsi forms that can
    exist are:</p>
    <pre>
   CVC     134     -bac-
    CVC     234     -lac
    CVV     13'5        -ba'i-
    CVV     135     -bai-
    CVV     23'5        -la'i-
    CVV     235     -lai-
    CCV     123     -bla-
</pre>(In fact, ``blaci'' has none of these short rafsi; they are all assigned to other
gismu. Lojban speakers are not free to reassign any of the rafsi; the tables shown here
are to help understand how the rafsi were chosen in the first place.)

    <p>There are a few restrictions: a CVV-form rafsi without an apostrophe cannot exist
    unless the vowels make up one of the four diphthongs ``ai'', ``ei'', ``oi'', or
    ``au''; and a CCV-form rafsi is possible only if the two consonants form a
    permissible initial consonant pair (see <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>). Thus ``mamta'',
    which has the same form as ``salci'', can only have ``mam'', ``mat'', and ``ma'a'' as
    possible rafsi: in fact, only ``mam'' is assigned to it.</p>

    <p>Some cmavo also have associated rafsi, usually CVC-form. For example, the ten
    common numerical digits, which are all CV form cmavo, each have a CVC-form rafsi
    formed by adding a consonant to the cmavo. Most cmavo that have rafsi are ones used
    in composing tanru (for a complete list, see <a href="chapter12.html">Chapter
    12</a>).</p>

    <p>The term for a lujvo made up solely of short rafsi is ``fully reduced lujvo''.
    Here are some examples of fully reduced lujvo:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  cumfri
    from ``cumki lifri''
    ``possible experience''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>   klezba
    from ``klesi zbasu''
    ``category make''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>   kixta'a
    from ``krixa tavla''
    ``cry-out talk''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>   sniju'o
    from ``sinxa djuno''
    ``sign know''
</pre>

    <p>In addition, some of the unreduced forms in the previous example may be fully
    reduced to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d10" name="e6d10">6.10)</a>    mampa'u
    from ``mamta patfu''
    ``mother father'' or ``maternal grandfather''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d11" name="e6d11">6.11)</a> lerste
    from ``lerfu liste''
    ``letter list'' or a ``list of letters''
</pre>As noted above, CVC-form rafsi cannot appear as the final rafsi in a lujvo, because
all lujvo must end with one or two vowels. As a brivla, a lujvo must also contain a
consonant cluster within the first five letters --- this ensures that they cannot be
mistaken for compound cmavo. Of course, all lujvo have at least six letters since they
have two or more rafsi, each at least three letters long; hence they cannot be confused
with gismu.

    <p>When attaching two rafsi together, it may be necessary to insert a hyphen letter.
    In Lojban, the term ``hyphen'' always refers to a letter, either the vowel ``y'' or
    one of the consonants ``r'' and ``n''. (The letter ``l'' can also be a hyphen, but is
    not used as one in lujvo.)</p>

    <p>The ``y''-hyphen is used after a CVC-form rafsi when joining it with the following
    rafsi could result in an impermissible consonant pair, or when the resulting lujvo
    could fall apart into two or more words (either cmavo or gismu).</p>

    <p>Thus, the tanru ``pante tavla'' (``protest talk'') cannot produce the lujvo
    ``patta'a'', because ``tt'' is not a permissible consonant pair; the lujvo must be
    ``patyta'a''. Similarly, the tanru ``mudri siclu'' (``wooden whistle'') cannot form
    the lujvo ``mudsiclu''; instead, ``mudysiclu'' must be used. (Remember that ``y'' is
    not counted in determining whether the first five letters of a brivla contain a
    consonant cluster: this is why.)</p>

    <p>The ``y''-hyphen is also used to attach a 4-letter rafsi, formed by dropping the
    final vowel of a gismu, to the following rafsi. (This procedure was shown, but not
    explained, in <a href="#e6d1">Examples 6.1</a> to <a href="#e6d5">6.5</a>.) The lujvo
    forms ``zunlyjamfu'', ``zunlyjma'', ``zuljamfu'', and ``zuljma'' are all legitimate
    and equivalent forms made from the tanru ``zunle jamfu'' (``left foot''). Of these,
    ``zuljma'' is the preferred one since it is the shortest; it thus is likely to be the
    form listed in a Lojban dictionary.</p>

    <p>The ``r''-hyphen and its close relative, the ``n''-hyphen, are used in lujvo only
    after CVV-form rafsi. A hyphen is always required in a two-part lujvo of the form
    CVV-CVV, since otherwise there would be no consonant cluster.</p>

    <p>An ``r-''hyphen or ``n''-hyphen is also required after the CVV-form rafsi of any
    lujvo of the form CVV-CVC/CV or CVV-CCVCV since it would otherwise fall apart into a
    CVV-form cmavo and a gismu. In any lujvo with more than two parts, a CVV-form rafsi
    in the initial position must always be followed by a hyphen. If the hyphen were to be
    omitted, the supposed lujvo could be broken into smaller words without the hyphen:
    because the CVV-form rafsi would be interpreted as a cmavo, and the remainder of the
    word as a valid lujvo that is one rafsi shorter.</p>

    <p>An ``n''-hyphen is only used in place of an ``r''-hyphen when the following rafsi
    begins with ``r''. For example, the tanru ``rokci renro'' (``rock throw'') cannot be
    expressed as ``ro'ire'o'' (which breaks up into two cmavo), nor can it be
    ``ro'irre'o'' (which has an impermissible double consonant); the ``n''-hyphen is
    required, and the correct form of the hyphenated lujvo is ``ro'inre'o''. The same
    lujvo could also be expressed without hyphenation as ``rokre'o''.</p>

    <p>There is also a different way of building lujvo, or rather phrases which are
    grammatically and semantically equivalent to lujvo. You can make a phrase containing
    any desired words, joining each pair of them with the special cmavo ``zei''.
    Thus,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d12" name="e6d12">6.12)</a>    bridi zei valsi
</pre>is the exact equivalent of ``brivla'' (but not necessarily the same as the
underlying tanru ``bridi valsi'', which could have other meanings.) Using ``zei'' is the
only way to get a cmavo lacking a rafsi, a cmene, or a fu'ivla into a lujvo:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d13" name="e6d13">6.13)</a>    xy. zei kantu
    X ray
</pre>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d16" name="e6d16">6.16)</a>    .cerman. zei xarnykarce
    Sherman war-car
    Sherman tank
</pre><a href="#e6d15">Example 6.15</a> is particularly noteworthy because the phrase
that would be produced by removing the ``zei''s from it doesn't end with a brivla, and in
fact is not even grammatical. As written, the example is a tanru with two components, but
by adding a ``zei'' between ``by.'' and ``livgyterbilma'' to produce
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e6d17" name="e6d17">6.17)</a>    na'e zei .a zei na'e zei by. zei livgyterbilma
    non-A-non-B-hepatitis
</pre>the whole phrase would become a single lujvo. The longer lujvo of <a href="#e6d17">
    Example 6.17</a> may be preferable, because its place structure can be built from
    that of ``bilma'', whereas the place structure of a lujvo without a brivla must be
    constructed ad hoc.

    <p>Note that rafsi may not be used in ``zei'' phrases, because they are not words.
    CVV rafsi look like words (specifically cmavo) but there can be no confusion between
    the two uses of the same letters, because cmavo appear only as separate words or in
    compound cmavo (which are really just a notation for writing separate but closely
    related words as if they were one); rafsi appear only as parts of lujvo.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s7" name="s7">7. fu'ivla</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s7" name="s7">The use of tanru or lujvo is not always appropriate for very
    concrete or specific terms (e.g. ``brie'' or ``cobra''), or for jargon words
    specialized to a narrow field (e.g. ``quark'', ``integral'', or ``iambic
    pentameter''). These words are in effect names for concepts, and the names were
    invented by speakers of another language. The vast majority of words referring to
    plants, animals, foods, and scientific terminology cannot be easily expressed as
    tanru. They thus must be borrowed (actually ``copied'') into Lojban from the original
    language.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s7" name="s7">There are four stages of borrowing in Lojban, as words become
    more and more modified (but shorter and easier to use). Stage 1 is the use of a
    foreign name quoted with the cmavo ``la'o'' (explained in full in</a> <a href=
    "chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  me la'o ly. spaghetti .ly.
</pre>is a predicate with the place structure ``x1 is a quantity of spaghetti''.

    <p>Stage 2 involves changing the foreign name to a Lojbanized name, as explained in
    <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  me la spagetis.
</pre>

    <p>One of these expedients is often quite sufficient when you need a word quickly in
    conversation. (This can make it easier to get by when you do not yet have full
    command of the Lojban vocabulary, provided you are talking to someone who will
    recognize the borrowing.)</p>

    <p>Where a little more universality is desired, the word to be borrowed must be
    Lojbanized into one of several permitted forms. A rafsi is then usually attached to
    the beginning of the Lojbanized form, using a hyphen to ensure that the resulting
    word doesn't fall apart.</p>

    <p>The rafsi categorizes or limits the meaning of the fu'ivla; otherwise a word
    having several different jargon meanings in other languages would require the
    word-inventor to choose which meaning should be assigned to the fu'ivla, since
    fu'ivla (like other brivla) are not permitted to have more than one definition. Such
    a Stage 3 borrowing is the most common kind of fu'ivla.</p>

    <p>Finally, Stage 4 fu'ivla do not have any rafsi classifier, and are used where a
    fu'ivla has become so common or so important that it must be made as short as
    possible. (See <a href="#s16">Section 16</a> for a proposal concerning Stage 4
    fu'ivla.)</p>

    <p>The form of a fu'ivla reliably distinguishes it from both the gismu and the cmavo.
    Like cultural gismu, fu'ivla are generally based on a word from a single non-Lojban
    language. The word is ``borrowed'' (actually ``copied'', hence the Lojban tanru
    ``fukpi valsi'') from the other language and Lojbanized --- the phonemes are
    converted to their closest Lojban equivalent and modifications are made as necessary
    to make the word a legitimate Lojban fu'ivla-form word. All fu'ivla:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>must contain a consonant cluster in the first five letters of the word; if this
      consonant cluster is at the beginning, it must either be a permissible initial
      consonant pair, or a longer cluster such that each pair of adjacent consonants in
      the cluster is a permissible initial consonant pair: ``spraile'' is acceptable, but
      not ``ktraile'' or ``trkaile'';</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>must end in one or more vowels;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>must not be gismu or lujvo, or any combination of cmavo, gismu, and lujvo;
      furthermore, a fu'ivla with a CV cmavo joined to the front of it must not have the
      form of a lujvo (the so-called ``slinku'i test'');</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>cannot contain ``y'', although they may contain syllabic pronunciations of
      Lojban consonants;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>like other brivla, are stressed on the penultimate syllable.</dd>
    </dl>Note that consonant triples or larger clusters that are not at the beginning of
    a fu'ivla can be quite flexible, as long as all consonant pairs are permissible.
    There is no need to restrict fu'ivla clusters to permissible initial pairs except at
    the beginning.

    <p>This is a fairly liberal definition and allows quite a lot of possibilities within
    ``fu'ivla space''. Stage 3 fu'ivla can be made easily on the fly, as lujvo can,
    because the procedure for forming them always guarantees a word that cannot violate
    any of the rules. Stage 4 fu'ivla require running tests that are not simple to
    characterize or perform, and should be made only after deliberation and by someone
    knowledgeable about all the considerations that apply.</p>

    <p>Here is a simple and reliable procedure for making a non-Lojban word into a valid
    Stage 3 fu'ivla:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Eliminate all double consonants and silent letters.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents. Lojban ``y'', however,
      may not be used in any fu'ivla.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>If the last letter is not a vowel, modify the ending so that the word ends in a
      vowel, either by removing a final consonant or by adding a suggestively chosen
      final vowel.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>If the first letter is not a consonant, modify the beginning so that the word
      begins with a consonant, either by removing an initial vowel or adding a
      suggestively chosen initial consonant.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>Prefix the result of steps 1-5 with a 4-letter rafsi that categorizes the
      fu'ivla into a ``topic area''. It is only safe to use a 4-letter rafsi; short rafsi
      sometimes produce invalid fu'ivla. Hyphenate the rafsi to the rest of the fu'ivla
      with an ``r''-hyphen; if that would produce a double ``r'', use an ``n''-hyphen
      instead; if the rafsi ends in ``r'' and the rest of the fu'ivla begins with ``n''
      (or vice versa) use an ``l''-hyphen. (This is the only use of ``l''-hyphen in
      Lojban.)</dd>

      <dd>Alternatively, if a CVC-form short rafsi is available it can be used instead of
      the long rafsi.</dd>

      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>Remember that the stress necessarily appears on the penultimate
      (next-to-the-last) syllable.</dd>
    </dl>In this section, the hyphen is set off with commas in the examples, but these
    commas are not required in writing, and the hyphen need not be pronounced as a
    separate syllable.

    <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  spaghetti (from English or Italian)
    spageti (Lojbanize)
    cidj,r,spageti (prefix long rafsi)
    dja,r,spageti (prefix short rafsi)
</pre>where ``cidj-'' is the 4-letter rafsi for ``cidja'', the Lojban gismu for ``food'',
thus categorizing ``cidjrspageti'' as a kind of food. The form with the short rafsi
happens to work, but such good fortune cannot be relied on: in any event, it means the
same thing.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  Acer (the scientific name of maple trees)
    acer (Lojbanize)
    xaceru (add initial consonant and final vowel)
    tric,r,xaceru (prefix rafsi)
    ric,r,xaceru (prefix short rafsi)
</pre>where ``tric-'' and ``ric-'' are rafsi for ``tricu'', the gismu for ``tree''. Note
that by the same principles, ``maple sugar'' could get the fu'ivla ``saktrxaceru'', or
could be represented by the tanru ``tricrxaceru sakta''. Technically, ``ricrxaceru'' and
``tricrxaceru'' are distinct fu'ivla, but they would surely be given the same meanings if
both happened to be in use.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  brie (from French)
    bri (Lojbanize)
    cirl,r,bri (prefix rafsi)
</pre>where ``cirl-'' represents ``cirla'' (``cheese'').
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  cobra
    kobra (Lojbanize)
    sinc,r,kobra (prefix rafsi)
</pre>where ``sinc-'' represents ``since'' (``snake'').
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  quark
    kuark (Lojbanize)
    kuarka (add final vowel)
    sask,r,kuarka (prefix rafsi)
</pre>where ``sask-'' represents ``saske'' (``science''). Note the extra vowel ``a''
added to the end of the word, and the diphthong ``ua'', which never appears in gismu or
lujvo, but may appear in fu'ivla.

    <p>The use of the prefix helps distinguish among the many possible meanings of the
    borrowed word, depending on the field. As it happens, ``spageti'' and ``kuarka'' are
    valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, but ``xaceru'' looks like a compound cmavo, and ``kobra'' like
    a gismu.</p>

    <p>For another example, ``integral'' has a specific meaning to a mathematician. But
    the Lojban fu'ivla ``integrale'', which is a valid Stage 4 fu'ivla, does not convey
    that mathematical sense to a non-mathematical listener, even one with an
    English-speaking background; its source --- the English word ``integral'' --- has
    various other specialized meanings in other fields.</p>

    <p>Left uncontrolled, ``integrale'' almost certainly would eventually come to mean
    the same collection of loosely related concepts that English associates with
    ``integral'', with only the context to indicate (possibly) that the mathematical term
    is meant.</p>

    <p>The prefix method would render the mathematical concept as ``cmacrntegrale'', if
    the ``i'' of ``integrale'' is removed, or something like ``cmacrnintegrale'', if a
    new consonant is added to the beginning; ``cmac-'' is the rafsi for ``cmaci''
    (``mathematics''). The architectural sense of ``integral'' might be conveyed with
    ``djinrnintegrale'' or ``tarmrnintegrale'', where ``dinju'' and ``tarmi'' mean
    ``building'' and ``form'' respectively.</p>

    <p>Here are some fu'ivla representing cultures and related things, shown with more
    than one rafsi prefix:</p>

</pre>Note the commas in <a href="#e7d11">Examples 7.11</a> and <a href=
"#e7d12">7.12</a>, used because ``ea'' is not a valid diphthong in Lojban. Arguably, some
form of the native name ``Chosen'' should have been used instead of the internationally
known ``Korea''; this is a recurring problem in all borrowings. In general, it is better
to use the native name unless using it will severely impede understanding: ``Navajo'' is
far more widely known than ``Dine'e''.

    Kate
</pre>Names may have almost any form, but always end in a consonant, and are followed by
a pause. They are penultimately stressed, unless unusual stress is marked with
capitalization. A name may have multiple parts, each ending with a consonant and pause,
or the parts may be combined into a single word with no pause. For example,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  djan.  djonz.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>    djandjonz.
</pre>are both valid Lojbanizations of ``John Jones''.

    <p>The final arbiter of the correct form of a name is the person doing the naming,
    although most cultures grant people the right to determine how they want their own
    name to be spelled and pronounced. The English name ``Mary'' can thus be Lojbanized
    as ``meris.'', ``maris.'', ``meiris.'', ``merix.'', or even ``marys.''. The last
    alternative is not pronounced much like its English equivalent, but may be desirable
    to someone who values spelling over pronunciation. The final consonant need not be an
    ``s''; there must, however, be some Lojban consonant at the end.</p>

    <p>Names are not permitted to have the sequences ``la'', ``lai'', or ``doi'' embedded
    in them, unless the sequence is immediately preceded by a consonant. These minor
    restrictions are due to the fact that all Lojban cmene embedded in a speech stream
    will be preceded by one of these words or by a pause. With one of these words
    embedded, the cmene might break up into valid Lojban words followed by a shorter
    cmene. However, break-up cannot happen after a consonant, because that would imply
    that the word before the ``la'', or whatever, ended in a consonant without pause,
    which is impossible.</p>

    <p>For example, the invalid name ``laplas.'' would look like the Lojban words ``la
    plas.'', and ``ilanas.'' would be misunderstood as ``.i la nas.''. However,
    ``nederlants.'' cannot be misheard as ``neder lants.'', because ``neder'' with no
    following pause is not a possible Lojban word.</p>

    <p>There are close alternatives to these forbidden sequences that can be used in
    Lojbanizing names, such as ``ly'', ``lei'', and ``dai'' or ``do'i'', that do not
    cause these problems.</p>

    <p>Lojban cmene are identifiable as word forms by the following characteristics:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>They must end in one or more consonants. There are no rules about how many
      consonants may appear in a cluster in cmene, provided that each consonant pair
      (whether standing by itself, or as part of a larger cluster) is a permissible
      pair.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>They may contain the letter y as a normal, non-hyphenating vowel. They are the
      only kind of Lojban word that may contain the two diphthongs ``iy'' and
      ``uy''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>They are always followed in speech by a pause after the final consonant,
      written as ``.''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>They may be stressed on any syllable; if this syllable is not the penultimate
      one, it must be capitalized when writing. Neither names nor words that begin
      sentences are capitalized in Lojban, so this is the only use of capital
      letters.</dd>
    </dl>Names meeting these criteria may be invented, Lojbanized from names in other
    languages, or formed by appending a consonant onto a cmavo, a gismu, a fu'ivla or a
    lujvo. Some cmene built from Lojban words are:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e8d11" name="e8d11">8.11)</a>    pav.
    the One
    from the cmavo ``pa'', with rafsi ``pav'', meaning ``one''
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e8d12" name="e8d12">8.12)</a>    sol.
    the Sun
    from the gismu ``solri'', meaning ``solar'', or actually
        ``pertaining to the Sun''
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e8d13" name="e8d13">8.13)</a>    ralj.
    Chief (as a title)
    from the gismu ``ralju'', meaning ``principal''.

    Lord/Lady
    from the gismu ``nobli'', with rafsi ``nol'',
        meaning ``noble''.
</pre>To Lojbanize a name from the various natural languages, apply the following rules:

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>Eliminate double consonants and silent letters.</dd>

      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>Add a final ``s'' or ``n'' (or some other consonant that sounds good) if the
      name ends in a vowel.</dd>

      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>Convert all sounds to their closest Lojban equivalents.</dd>

      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>If possible and acceptable, shift the stress to the penultimate
      (next-to-the-last) syllable. Use commas and capitalization in written Lojban when
      it is necessary to preserve non-standard syllabication or stress. Do not capitalize
      names otherwise.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>5)</dt>

      <dd>If the name contains an impermissible consonant pair, insert a vowel between
      the consonants: ``y'' is recommended.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>6)</dt>

      <dd>No cmene may have the syllables ``la'', ``lai'', or ``doi'' in them, unless
      immediately preceded by a consonant. If these combinations are present, they must
      be converted to something else. Possible substitutions include ``ly'', ``ly'i'',
      and ``dai'' or ``do'i'', respectively.</dd>
    </dl>There are some additional rules for Lojbanizing the scientific names
    (technically known as ``Linnaean binomials'' after their inventor) which are
    internationally applied to each species of animal or plant. Where precision is
    essential, these names need not be Lojbanized, but can be directly inserted into
    Lojban text using the cmavo ``la'o'', explained in <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter
    19</a>. Using this cmavo makes the already lengthy Latinized names at least four
    syllables longer, however, and leaves the pronunciation in doubt. The following
    suggestions, though incomplete, will assist in converting Linnaean binomals to valid
    Lojban names. They can also help to create fu'ivla based on Linnaean binomials or
    other words of the international scientific vocabulary. The term ``back vowel'' in
    the following list refers to any of the letters ``a'', ``o'', or ``u''; the term
    ``front vowel'' correspondingly refers to any of the letters ``e'', ``i'', or ``y''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s10" name="s10">10. Considerations for making lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s10" name="s10">Given a tanru which expresses an idea to be used
    frequently, it can be turned into a lujvo by following the lujvo-making algorithm
    which is given in</a> <a href="#s11">Section 11</a>.</p>

    <p>In building a lujvo, the first step is to replace each gismu with a rafsi that
    uniquely represents that gismu. These rafsi are then attached together by fixed rules
    that allow the resulting compound to be recognized as a single word and to be
    analyzed in only one way.</p>

    <p>There are three other complications; only one is serious.</p>

    <p>The first is that there is usually more than one rafsi that can be used for each
    gismu. The one to be used is simply whichever one sounds or looks best to the speaker
    or writer. There are usually many valid combinations of possible rafsi. They all are
    equally valid, and all of them mean exactly the same thing. (The scoring algorithm
    given in <a href="#s12">Section 12</a> is used to choose the standard form of the
    lujvo --- the version which would be entered into a dictionary.)</p>

    <p>The second complication is the serious one. Remember that a tanru is ambiguous ---
    it has several possible meanings. A lujvo, or at least one that would be put into the
    dictionary, has just a single meaning. Like a gismu, a lujvo is a predicate which
    encompasses one area of the semantic universe, with one set of places. Hopefully the
    meaning chosen is the most useful of the possible semantic spaces. A possible source
    of linguistic drift in Lojban is that as Lojbanic society evolves, the concept that
    seems the most useful one may change.</p>

    <p>You must also be aware of the possibility of some prior meaning of a new lujvo,
    especially if you are writing for posterity. If a lujvo is invented which involves
    the same tanru as one that is in the dictionary, and is assigned a different meaning
    (or even just a different place structure), linguistic drift results. This isn't
    necessarily bad. Every natural language does it. But in communication, when you use a
    meaning different from the dictionary definition, someone else may use the dictionary
    and therefore misunderstand you. You can use the cmavo ``za'e'' (explained in
    <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>) before a newly coined lujvo to indicate that
    it may have a non-dictionary meaning.</p>

    <p>The essential nature of human communication is that if the listener understands,
    then all is well. Let this be the ultimate guideline for choosing meanings and place
    structures for invented lujvo.</p>

    <p>The third complication is also simple, but tends to scare new Lojbanists with its
    implications. It is based on Zipf's Law, which says that the length of words is
    inversely proportional to their usage. The shortest words are those which are used
    more; the longest ones are used less. Conversely, commonly used concepts will be tend
    to be abbreviated. In English, we have abbreviations and acronyms and jargon, all of
    which represent complex ideas that are used often by small groups of people, so they
    shortened them to convey more information more rapidly.</p>

    <p>Therefore, given a complicated tanru with grouping markers, abstraction markers,
    and other cmavo in it to make it syntactically unambiguous, the psychological basis
    of Zipf's Law may compel the lujvo-maker to drop some of the cmavo to make a shorter
    (technically incorrect) tanru, and then use that tanru to make the lujvo.</p>

    <p>This doesn't lead to ambiguity, as it might seem to. A given lujvo still has
    exactly one meaning and place structure. It is just that more than one tanru is
    competing for the same lujvo. But more than one meaning for the tanru was already
    competing for the ``right'' to define the meaning of the lujvo. Someone has to use
    judgment in deciding which one meaning is to be chosen over the others.</p>

    <p>If the lujvo made by a shorter form of tanru is in use, or is likely to be useful
    for another meaning, the decider then retains one or more of the cmavo, preferably
    ones that set this meaning apart from the shorter form meaning that is used or
    anticipated. As a rule, therefore, the shorter lujvo will be used for a more general
    concept, possibly even instead of a more frequent word. If both words are needed, the
    simpler one should be shorter. It is easier to add a cmavo to clarify the meaning of
    the more complex term than it is to find a good alternate tanru for the simpler
    term.</p>

    <p>And of course, we have to consider the listener. On hearing an unknown word, the
    listener will decompose it and get a tanru that makes no sense or the wrong sense for
    the context. If the listener realizes that the grouping operators may have been
    dropped out, he or she may try alternate groupings, or try inserting an abstraction
    operator if that seems plausible. (The grouping of tanru is explained in <a href=
    "chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>; abstraction is explained in <a href=
    "chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>.) Plausibility is the key to learning new ideas and
    to evaluating unfamiliar lujvo.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s13" name="s13">13. lujvo-making examples</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s13" name="s13">This section contains examples of making and scoring lujvo.
    First, we will start with the tanru ``gerku zdani'' (``dog house'') and construct a
    lujvo meaning ``doghouse'', that is, a house where a dog lives. We will use a
    brute-force application of the algorithm in</a> <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>, using
    every possible rafsi.</p>

    <p>The rafsi for ``gerku'' are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>-ger-, -ge'u-, -gerk-, -gerku</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The rafsi for ``zdani'' are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>-zda-, -zdan-, -zdani.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Step 1 of the algorithm directs us to use ``-ger-'', ``-ge'u-'' and ``-gerk-'' as
    possible rafsi for ``gerku''; Step 2 directs us to use ``-zda-'' and ``-zdani'' as
    possible rafsi for ``zdani''. The six possible forms of the lujvo are then:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>ger-zda ger-zdani ge'u-zda ge'u-zdani gerk-zda gerk-zdani</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>We must then insert appropriate hyphens in each case. The first two forms need no
    hyphenation: ``ge'' cannot fall off the front, because the following word would begin
    with ``rz'', which is not a permissible initial consonant pair. So the lujvo forms
    are ``gerzda'' and ``gerzdani''.</p>

    <p>The third form, ``ge'u-zda'', needs no hyphen, because even though the first rafsi
    is CVV, the second one is CCV, so there is a consonant cluster in the first five
    letters. So ``ge'uzda'' is this form of the lujvo.</p>

    <p>The fourth form, ``ge'u-zdani'', however, requires an ``r''-hyphen; otherwise, the
    ``ge'u-'' part would fall off as a cmavo. So this form of the lujvo is
    ``ge'urzdani''.</p>

    <p>The last two forms require ``y''-hyphens, as all 4-letter rafsi do, and so are
    ``gerkyzda'' and ``gerkyzdani'' respectively.</p>

    <p>The scoring algorithm is heavily weighted in favor of short lujvo, so we might
    expect that ``gerzda'' would win. Its L score is 6, its A score is 0, its H score is
    0, its R score is 12, and its V score is 3, for a final score of 5878. The other
    forms have scores of 7917, 6367, 9506, 8008, and 10047 respectively. Consequently,
    this lujvo would probably appear in the dictionary in the form ``gerzda''.</p>

    <p>For the next example, we will use the tanru ``bloti klesi'' (``boat class'')
    presumably referring to the category (rowboat, motorboat, cruise liner) into which a
    boat falls. We will omit the long rafsi from the process, since lujvo containing long
    rafsi are almost never preferred by the scoring algorithm when there are short rafsi
    available.</p>

    <p>The rafsi for ``bloti'' are ``-lot-'', ``-blo-'', and ``-lo'i-''; for ``klesi''
    they are ``-kle-'' and ``-lei-''. Both these gismu are among the handful which have
    both CVV-form and CCV-form rafsi, so there is an unusual number of possibilities
    available for a two-part tanru:</p>
    <pre>
   lotkle      blokle      lo'ikle
    lotlei      blolei      lo'irlei
</pre>

    <p>Only ``lo'irlei'' requires hyphenation (to avoid confusion with the cmavo sequence
    ``lo'i lei''). All six forms are valid versions of the lujvo, as are the six further
    forms using long rafsi; however, the scoring algorithm produces the following
    results:</p>
    <pre>
   lotkle 5878 blokle 5858 lo'ikle 6367
    lotlei 5867 blolei 5847 lo'irlei 7456
</pre>

    <p>So the form ``blolei'' is preferred, but only by a tiny margin over ``blokle'';
    the next two forms are only slightly worse; ``lo'ikle'' suffers because of its
    apostrophe, and ``lo'irlei'' because of having both apostrophe and hyphen.</p>

    <p>Our third example will result in forming both a lujvo and a name from the tanru
    ``logji bangu girzu'', or ``logical-language group'' in English. (``The Logical
    Language Group'' is the name of the publisher of this book and the organization for
    the promotion of Lojban.) The available rafsi are ``-loj-'' and ``-logj-'';
    ``-ban-'', ``-bau-'', and ``-bang-''; and ``-gri-'' and ``-girzu'', and (for name
    purposes only) ``-gir-'' and ``-girz-''. The resulting 12 lujvo possibilities
    are:</p>
    <pre>
   loj-ban-gri loj-bau-gri loj-bang-gri
    logj-ban-gri    logj-bau-gri    logj-bang-gri
    loj-ban-girzu   loj-bau-girzu   loj-bang-girzu
    logj-ban-girzu  logj-bau-girzu  logj-bang-girzu
</pre>and the 12 name possibilities are:
    <pre>
   loj-ban-gir.    loj-bau-gir.    loj-bang-gir.
    logj-ban-gir.   logj-bau-gir.   logj-bang-gir.
    loj-ban-girz.   loj-bau-girz.   loj-bang-girz.
    logj-ban-girz.  logj-bau-girz.  logj-bang-girz.
</pre>

    <p>After hyphenation, we have:</p>
    <pre>
   lojbangri   lojbaugri   lojbangygri
    logjybangri logjybaugri logjybangygri
    lojbangirzu lojbaugirzu lojbangygirzu
    logjybangirzu   logjybaugirzu   logjybangygirzu

    lojbangir.  lojbaugir.  lojbangygir.
    logjybangir.    logjybaugir.    logjybangygir.
    lojbangirz. lojbaugirz. lojbangygirz.
    logjybangirz.   logjybaugirz.   logjybangygirz.
</pre>

    <p>The only fully reduced lujvo forms are ``lojbangri'' and ``lojbaugri'', of which
    the latter has a slightly lower score: 8827 versus 8796, respectively. However, for
    the name of the organization, we chose to make sure the name of the language was
    embedded in it, and to use the clearer long-form rafsi for ``girzu'', producing
    ``lojbangirz.''</p>

    <p>Finally, here is a four-part lujvo with a cmavo in it, based on the tanru ``nakni
    ke cinse ctuca'' or ``male (sexual teacher)''. The ``ke'' cmavo ensures the
    interpretation ``teacher of sexuality who is male'', rather than ``teacher of male
    sexuality''. Here are the possible forms of the lujvo, both before and after
    hyphenation:</p>
    <pre>
   nak-kem-cin-ctu     nakykemcinctu
    nak-kem-cin-ctuca   nakykemcinctuca
    nak-kem-cins-ctu    nakykemcinsyctu
    nak-kem-cins-ctuca  nakykemcinsyctuca
    nakn-kem-cin-ctu    naknykemcinctu
    nakn-kem-cin-ctuca  naknykemcinctuca
    nakn-kem-cins-ctu   naknykemcinsyctu
    nakn-kem-cins-ctuca naknykemcinsyctuca
</pre>

    <p>Of these forms, ``nakykemcinctu'' is the shortest and is preferred by the scoring
    algorithm. On the whole, however, it might be better to just make a lujvo for ``cinse
    ctuca'' (which would be ``cinctu'') since the sex of the teacher is rarely important.
    If there was a reason to specify ``male'', then the simpler tanru ``nakni cinctu''
    (``male sexual-teacher'') would be appropriate. This tanru is actually shorter than
    the four-part lujvo, since the ``ke'' required for grouping need not be
    expressed.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s16" name="s16">16. rafsi fu'ivla: a proposal</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-s16" name="s16">The list of cultures represented by gismu, given in</a>
    <a href="#s15">Section 15</a>, is unavoidably controversial. Much time has been spent
    debating whether this or that culture ``deserves a gismu'' or ``must languish in
    fu'ivla space''. To help defuse this argument, a last-minute proposal was made when
    this book was already substantially complete. I have added it here with experimental
    status: it is not yet a standard part of Lojban, since all its implications have not
    been tested in open debate, and it affects a part of the language (lujvo-making) that
    has long been stable, but is known to be fragile in the face of small changes. (Many
    attempts were made to add general mechanisms for making lujvo that contained fu'ivla,
    but all failed on obvious or obscure counterexamples; finally the general ``zei''
    mechanism was devised instead.)</p>

    <p>The first part of the proposal is uncontroversial and involves no change to the
    language mechanisms. All valid Type 4 fu'ivla of the form CCVVCV would be reserved
    for cultural brivla analogous to those described in <a href="#s15">Section 15</a>.
    For example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    tci'ile
    Chilean
</pre>is of the appropriate form, and passes all tests required of a Stage 4 fu'ivla. No
two fu'ivla of this form would be allowed to coexist if they differed only in the final
vowel; this rule was applied to gismu, but does not apply to other fu'ivla or to lujvo.

    <p>The second, and fully experimental, part of the proposal is to allow rafsi to be
    formed from these cultural fu'ivla by removing the final vowel and treating the
    result as a 4-letter rafsi (although it would contain five letters, not four). These
    rafsi could then be used on a par with all other rafsi in forming lujvo. The
    tanru</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a>    tci'ile ke canre tutra
    Chilean type-of (sand territory)
    Chilean desert
</pre>could be represented by the lujvo
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-4-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    tci'ilykemcantutra
</pre>which is an illegal word in standard Lojban, but a valid lujvo under this proposal.
There would be no short rafsi or 5-letter rafsi assigned to any fu'ivla, so no fu'ivla
could appear as the last element of a lujvo.

    <p>The cultural fu'ivla introduced under this proposal are called ``rafsi fu'ivla'',
    since they are distinguished from other Type 4 fu'ivla by the property of having
    rafsi. If this proposal is workable and introduces no problems into Lojban
    morphology, it might become standard for all Type 4 fu'ivla, including those made for
    plants, animals, foodstuffs, and other things.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s1" name="s1">1. Lojban content words: brivla</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s1" name="s1">At the center, logically and often physically, of every
    Lojban bridi is one or more words which constitute the selbri. A bridi expresses a
    relationship between things: the selbri specifies which relationship is referred to.
    The difference between:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  do mamta mi
    You are-a-mother-of me.
    You are my mother.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  do patfu mi
    You are-a-father-of me.
    You are my father.
</pre>lies in the different selbri.

    <p>The simplest kind of selbri is a single Lojban content word: a brivla. There are
    three different varieties of brivla: those which are built into the language (the
    gismu), those which are derived from combinations of the gismu (the lujvo), and those
    which are taken (usually in a modified form) from other languages (the fu'ivla). In
    addition, there are a few cmavo that can act like brivla; these are mentioned in
    <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>, and discussed in full in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter
    7</a>.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of this chapter, however, all brivla are alike. For example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  ta bloti
    That is-a-boat.
    That is a boat.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>   ta brablo
    that is-a-large-boat.
    That is a ship.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  ta blotrskunri
    That is-a-(boat)-schooner.
    That is a schooner.
</pre>illustrate the three types of brivla (gismu, lujvo, and fu'ivla respectively), but
in each case the selbri is composed of a single word whose meaning can be learned
independent of its origins.

    <p>The remainder of this chapter will mostly use gismu as example brivla, because
    they are short. However, it is important to keep in mind that wherever a gismu
    appears, it could be replaced by any other kind of brivla.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s2" name="s2">2. Simple tanru</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s2" name="s2">Beyond the single brivla, a selbri may consist of two brivla
    placed together. When a selbri is built in this way from more than one brivla, it is
    called a tanru, a word with no single English equivalent. The nearest analogue to
    tanru in English are combinations of two nouns such as ``lemon tree''. There is no
    way to tell just by looking at the phrase ``lemon tree'' exactly what it refers to,
    even if you know the meanings of ``lemon'' and ``tree'' by themselves. As
    English-speakers, we must simply know that it refers to ``a tree which bears lemons
    as fruits''. A person who didn't know English very well might think of it as
    analogous to ``brown tree'' and wonder, ``What kind of tree is
    lemon-colored?''</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s2" name="s2">In Lojban, tanru are also used for the same purposes as
    English adjective- noun combinations like ``big boy'' and adverb-verb combinations
    like ``quickly run''. This is a consequence of Lojban not having any such categories
    as ``noun'', ``verb'', ``adjective'', or ``adverb''. English words belonging to any
    of these categories are translated by simple brivla in Lojban. Here are some examples
    of tanru:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s2" name="s2"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s2" name="s2"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  tu pelnimre tricu
    that-yonder is-a-(lemon tree).
    That is a lemon tree.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   la djan. barda nanla
    John is-a-big boy.
    John is a big boy.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>   mi sutra bajra
    I quick run.
    I quickly run/I run quickly.
</pre>

    <p>Note that ``pelnimre'' is a lujvo for ``lemon''; it is derived from the gismu
    ``pelxu'', yellow, and ``nimre'', citrus. Note also that ``sutra'' can mean
    ``fast/quick'' or ``quickly'' depending on its use:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  mi sutra
    I am-fast/quick.
</pre>shows ``sutra'' used to translate an adjective, whereas in <a href="#e2d3">Example
2.3</a> it is translating an adverb. (Another correct translation of <a href=
"#e2d3">Example 2.3</a>, however, would be ``I am a quick runner''.)

    <p>There are special Lojban terms for the two components of a tanru, derived from the
    place structure of the word ``tanru''. The first component is called the ``seltau'',
    and the second component is called the ``tertau''.</p>

    <p>The most important rule for use in interpreting tanru is that the tertau carries
    the primary meaning. A ``pelnimre tricu'' is primarily a tree, and only secondarily
    is it connected with lemons in some way. For this reason, an alternative translation
    of <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a> would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  That is a lemon type of tree.
</pre>

    <p>This ``type of'' relationship between the components of a tanru is fundamental to
    the tanru concept.</p>

    <p>We may also say that the seltau modifies the meaning of the tertau:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  That is a tree which is lemon-ish
        (in the way appropriate to trees)
</pre>would be another possible translation of <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>. In the
same way, a more explicit translation of <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a> might be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  John is a boy who is big in the way that boys are big.
</pre>

    <p>This ``way that boys are big'' would be quite different from the way in which
    elephants are big; big-for-a-boy is small-for-an-elephant.</p>

    <p>All tanru are ambiguous semantically. Possible translations of:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  ta klama jubme
    That is-a-goer type-of-table.
</pre>include:

    <dl>
      <dd>That is a table which goes (a wheeled table, perhaps). That is a table owned by
      one who goes. That is a table used by those who go (a sports doctor's table?). That
      is a table when it goes (otherwise it is a chair?).</dd>
    </dl>In each case the object referred to is a ``goer type of table'', but the
    ambiguous ``type of'' relationship can mean one of many things. A speaker who uses
    tanru (and pragmatically all speakers must) takes the risk of being misunderstood.
    Using tanru is convenient because they are short and expressive; the circumlocution
    required to squeeze out all ambiguity can require too much effort.

    <p>No general theory covering the meaning of all possible tanru exists; probably no
    such theory can exist. However, some regularities obviously do exist:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>  do barda prenu
    You are-a-large person.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e2d10" name="e2d10">2.10)</a> do cmalu prenu
    You are-a-small person.
</pre>are parallel tanru, in the sense that the relationship between ``barda'' and
``prenu'' is the same as that between ``cmalu'' and ``prenu''. <a href="#s14">Section
14</a> and <a href="#s15">Section 15</a> contain a partial listing of some types of
tanru, with examples.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s3" name="s3">3. Three-part tanru grouping with ``bo''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s3" name="s3">   bo  BO  closest scope grouping
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s3" name="s3">Consider the English sentence:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  That's a little girls' school.
</pre>

    <p>What does it mean? Two possible readings are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  That's a little school for girls.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>   That's a school for little girls.
</pre>This ambiguity is quite different from the simple tanru ambiguity described in
<a href="#s2">Section 2</a>. We understand that ``girls' school'' means ``a school where
girls are the students'', and not ``a school where girls are the teachers'' or ``a school
which is a girl'' (!). Likewise, we understand that ``little girl'' means ``girl who is
small''. This is an ambiguity of grouping. Is ``girls' school'' to be taken as a unit,
with ``little'' specifying the type of girls' school? Or is ``little girl'' to be taken
as a unit, specifying the type of school? In English speech, different tones of voice, or
exaggerated speech rhythm showing the grouping, are used to make the distinction; English
writing usually leaves it unrepresented.

    <p>Lojban makes no use of tones of voice for any purpose; explicit words are used to
    do the work. The cmavo ``bo'' (which belongs to selma'o BO) may be placed between the
    two brivla which are most closely associated. Therefore, a Lojban translation of
    <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a> would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-small girl -- school.
</pre><a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> might be translated:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
    That is-a-small -- girl school.
</pre>

    <p>The ``bo'' is represented in the literal translation by a hyphen because in
    written English a hyphen is sometimes used for the same purpose: ``a big
    dog-catcher'' would be quite different from a ``big-dog catcher'' (presumably someone
    who catches only big dogs).</p>

    <p>Analysis of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> and <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>
    reveals a tanru nested within a tanru. In <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, the main
    tanru has a seltau of ``cmalu'' and a tertau of ``nixli bo ckule''; the tertau is
    itself a tanru with ``nixli'' as the seltau and ``ckule'' as the tertau. In <a href=
    "#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, the seltau is ``cmalu bo nixli'' (itself
    a tanru), whereas the tertau is ``ckule''. This structure of tanru nested within
    tanru forms the basis for all the more complex types of selbri that will be explained
    below.</p>

    <p>What about <a href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a>? What does it mean?</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  ta cmalu nixli ckule
    That is-a-small girl school.
</pre>The rules of Lojban do not leave this sentence ambiguous, as the rules of English
do with <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a>. The choice made by the language designers is to
say that <a href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a> means the same as <a href="#e3d5">Example
3.5</a>. This is true no matter what three brivla are used: the leftmost two are always
grouped together. This rule is called the ``left-grouping rule''. Left-grouping in
seemingly ambiguous structures is quite common --- though not universal --- in other
contexts in Lojban.

    <p>Another way to express the English meaning of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> and
    <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, using parentheses to mark grouping, is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  ta cmalu nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-small type-of (girl type-of school).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>   ta cmalu bo nixli ckule
    That is-a-(small type-of girl) type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>Because ``type-of'' is implicit in the Lojban tanru form, it has no Lojban
    equivalent.</p>

    <p>Note: It is perfectly legal, though pointless, to insert ``bo'' into a simple
    tanru:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  ta klama bo jubme
    That is-a goer -- table
</pre>is a legal Lojban bridi that means exactly the same thing as <a href=
"#e2d8">Example 2.8</a>, and is ambiguous in exactly the same ways. The cmavo ``bo''
serves only to resolve grouping ambiguity: it says nothing about the more basic ambiguity
present in all tanru.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s4" name="s4">4. Complex tanru grouping</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s4" name="s4">If one element of a tanru can be another tanru, why not both
    elements?</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s4" name="s4"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d1" name=
"e4d1">4.1)</a>  do mutce bo barda gerku bo kavbu
    You are-a-(very type-of large) (dog type-of capturer).
    You are a very large dog-catcher.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a>, the selbri is a tanru with seltau ``mutce bo
    barda'' and tertau ``gerku bo kavbu''. It is worth emphasizing once again that this
    tanru has the same fundamental ambiguity as all other Lojban tanru: the sense in
    which the ``dog type-of capturer'' is said to be ``very type-of large'' is not
    precisely specified. Presumably it is his body which is large, but theoretically it
    could be one of his other properties.</p>

    <p>We will now justify the title of this chapter by exploring the ramifications of
    the phrase ``pretty little girls' school'', an expansion of the tanru used in
    <a href="#s3">Section 3</a> to four brivla. (Although this example has been used in
    the Loglan Project almost since the beginning --- it first appeared in Quine's book
    <cite>Word and Object</cite> (1960) --- it is actually a mediocre example because of
    the ambiguity of English ``pretty''; it can mean ``beautiful'', the sense intended
    here, or it can mean ``very''. Lojban ``melbi'' is not subject to this ambiguity: it
    means only ``beautiful''.) Here are four ways to group this phrase:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  ta melbi cmalu
        nixli ckule
    That is-a-((pretty type-of little)
        type-of girl) type-of school.
    That is a school for girls who are beautifully small.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>   ta melbi cmalu nixli bo ckule

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>   ta melbi cmalu bo nixli
        ckule
    That is-a-(pretty type-of (little type-of girl))
        type-of school.
    That is a school for small girls who are beautiful.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>   ta melbi cmalu bo
        nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-pretty type-of (little type-of
        (girl type-of school)).
    That is a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre><a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> uses a construction which has not been seen before:
``cmalu bo nixli bo ckule'', with two consecutive uses of ``bo'' between brivla. The rule
for multiple ``bo'' constructions is the opposite of the rule when no ``bo'' is present
at all: the last two are grouped together. Not surprisingly, this is called the
``right-grouping rule'', and it is associated with every use of ``bo'' in the language.
Therefore,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  ta cmalu bo nixli bo ckule
    That is-a-little type-of (girl type-of school).
</pre>means the same as <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, not <a href="#e3d5">Example
3.5</a>. This rule may seem peculiar at first, but one of its consequences is that ``bo''
is never necessary between the first two elements of any of the complex tanru presented
so far: all of <a href="#e4d2">Examples 4.2</a> through <a href="#e4d5">4.5</a> could
have ``bo'' inserted between ``melbi'' and ``cmalu'' with no change in meaning.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s5" name="s5">5. Complex tanru with ``ke'' and ``ke'e''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s5" name="s5">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s5" name="s5">   ke  KE  start grouping
    ke'e    KEhE    end grouping
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s5" name="s5">There is, in fact, a fifth grouping of ``pretty little girls'
school'' that cannot be expressed with the resources explained so far. To handle it, we
must introduce the grouping parentheses cmavo, ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' (belonging to selma'o
KE and KEhE respectively). Any portion of a selbri sandwiched between these two cmavo is
taken to be a single tanru component, independently of what is adjacent to it. Thus,</a>
<a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> can be rewritten in any of the following ways:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  ta ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ckule
    That is-a-( pretty little ) girl school.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>   ta ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
    That is-a-( ( pretty little ) girl ) school.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>   ta ke ke ke melbi cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule ke'e
    That is-a-( ( ( pretty little ) girl ) school ).
</pre>

    <p>Even more versions could be created simply by placing any number of ``ke'' cmavo
    at the beginning of the selbri, and a like number of ``ke'e'' cmavo at its end.
    Obviously, all of these are a waste of breath once the left-grouping rule has been
    grasped. However, the following is equivalent to <a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> and
    may be easier to understand:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  ta melbi ke cmalu nixli ke'e
        ckule
    That is-a-(pretty type-of ( little type-of girl ))
        type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, a ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' version of <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> would
    be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ta melbi cmalu
        ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-(pretty type-of little)
        ( girl type-of school ).
</pre>

    <p>The final ``ke'e'' is given in square brackets here to indicate that it can be
    elided. It is always possible to elide ``ke'e'' at the end of the selbri, making
    <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a> as terse as <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a>.</p>

    <p>Now how about that fifth grouping? It is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ta melbi
        ke cmalu nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-pretty type-of
        ( (little type-of girl) type-of school )
    That is a beautiful school for small girls.
</pre><a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a> is distinctly different in meaning from any of
Examples 4.2 through 4.5. Note that within the ``ke ... ke'e'' parentheses, the
left-grouping rule is applied to ``cmalu nixli ckule''.

    <p>It is perfectly all right to mix ``bo'' and ``ke ... ke'e'' in a single selbri.
    For instance, <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a>, which in pure ``ke ... ke'e'' form
    is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ta melbi

    gi  GI  forethought connection separator
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s6" name="s6">Consider the English phrase ``big red dog''. How shall this be
rendered as a Lojban tanru? The naive attempt:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  barda xunre gerku
    (big type-of red) type-of dog
</pre>will not do, as it means a dog whose redness is big, in whatever way redness might
be described as ``big''. Nor is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  barda xunre bo gerku
    big type-of (red type-of dog)
</pre>much better. After all, the straightforward understanding of the English phrase is
that the dog is big as compared with other dogs, not merely as compared with other red
dogs. In fact, the bigness and redness are independent properties of the dog, and only
obscure rules of English adjective ordering prevent us from saying ``red big dog''.

    <p>The Lojban approach to this problem is to introduce the cmavo ``je'', which is one
    of the many equivalents of English ``and''. A big red dog is one that is both big and
    red, and we can say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  barda je xunre gerku
    (big and red) type-of dog
</pre>

    <p>Of course,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  xunre je barda gerku
    (red and big) type-of dog
</pre>is equally satisfactory and means the same thing. As these examples indicate,
joining two brivla with ``je'' makes them a unit for tanru purposes. However, explicit
grouping with ``bo'' or ``ke ... ke'e'' associates brivla more closely than ``je'' does:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  barda je pelxu bo xunre gerku
    barda je ke pelxu xunre ke'e gerku
    (big and (yellow type-of red)) dog
    big yellowish-red dog
</pre>

    <p>With no grouping indicators, we get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  barda je pelxu xunre gerku
    ((big and yellow) type-of red) type-of dog
    biggish- and yellowish-red dog
</pre>which again raises the question of <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>: what is does
``biggish-red'' mean?

    <p>Unlike ``bo'' and ``ke ... ke'e'', ``je'' is useful as well as merely legal within
    simple tanru. It may be used to partly resolve the ambiguity of simple tanru:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  ta blanu je zdani
    that is-blue and is-a-house
</pre>definitely refers to something which is both blue and is a house, and not to any of
the other possible interpretations of simple ``blanu zdani''. Furthermore, ``blanu
zdani'' refers to something which is blue in the way that houses are blue; ``blanu je
zdani'' has no such implication --- the blueness of a ``blanu je zdani'' is independent
of its houseness.

    <p>With the addition of ``je'', many more versions of ``pretty little girls' school''
    are made possible: see <a href="#s16">Section 16</a> for a complete list.</p>

    <p>A subtle point in the semantics of tanru like <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a>
    needs special elucidation. There are at least two possible interpretations of:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  ta melbi je nixli ckule
    That is-a-(beautiful and girl) type-of school.
</pre>

    <p>It can be understood as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>  That is a girls' school and a beautiful school.
</pre>or as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d10" name="e6d10">6.10)</a>    That is a school for things
        which are both girls and beautiful.
</pre>The interpretation specified by <a href="#e6d9">Example 6.9</a> treats the tanru as
a sort of abbreviation for:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d11" name="e6d11">6.11)</a>    ta ke melbi ckule ke'e
        je ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
    That is-a-( beautiful type-of school )
        and ( girl type-of school )
</pre>whereas the interpretation specified by <a href="#e6d10">Example 6.10</a> does not.
This is a kind of semantic ambiguity for which Lojban does not compel a firm resolution.
The way in which the school is said to be of type ``beautiful and girl'' may entail that
it is separately a beautiful school and a girls' school; but the alternative
interpretation, that the members of the school are beautiful and girls, is also possible.
Still another interpretation is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d12" name="e6d12">6.12)</a>    That is a school for beautiful things
        and also for girls.
</pre>so while the logical connectives help to resolve the meaning of tanru, they by no
means compel a single meaning in and of themselves.

    <p>In general, logical connectives within tanru cannot undergo the formal
    manipulations that are possible with the related logical connectives that exist
    outside tanru; see <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> for further details.</p>

    <p>The logical connective ``je'' is only one of the fourteen logical connectives that
    Lojban provides. Here are a few examples of some of the others:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d13" name="e6d13">6.13)</a>    le bajra cu jinga ja te jinga
    the runner(s) is/are winner(s) or loser(s).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d14" name="e6d14">6.14)</a> blanu naja lenku skapi
    (blue only-if cold) skin
    skin which is blue only if it is cold

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d15" name="e6d15">6.15)</a> xamgu jo cortu nuntavla
    (good if-and-only-if short) speech
    speech which is good if (and only if) it is short

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d16" name="e6d16">6.16)</a> vajni ju pluka nuntavla
    (important whether-or-not pleasing) event-of-talking
    speech which is important, whether or not it is pleasing
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e6d13">Example 6.13</a>, ``ja'' is grammatically equivalent to ``je''
    but means ``or'' (more precisely, ``and/or''). Likewise, ``naja'' means ``only if''
    in <a href="#e6d14">Example 6.14</a>, ``jo'' means ``if and only if'' in <a href=
    "#e6d15">Example 6.15</a>, and ``ju'' means ``whether or not'' in <a href=
    "#e6d16">Example 6.16</a>.</p>

    <p>Now consider the following example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d17" name="e6d17">6.17)</a>    ricfu je blanu jabo crino
    rich and (blue or green)
</pre>which illustrates a new grammatical feature: the use of both ``ja'' and ``bo''
between tanru components. The two cmavo combine to form a compound whose meaning is that
of ``ja'' but which groups more closely; ``jabo'' is to ``ja'' as plain ``bo'' is to no
cmavo at all. However, both ``ja'' and ``jabo'' group less closely than ``bo'' does:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d18" name="e6d18">6.18)</a>    ricfu je blanu jabo crino bo blanu
    rich and (blue or green -- blue)
    rich and (blue or greenish-blue)
</pre>

    <p>An alternative form of <a href="#e6d17">Example 6.17</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d19" name="e6d19">6.19)</a>    ricfu je ke blanu ja crino [ke'e]
    rich and ( blue or green )
</pre>In addition to the logical connectives, there are also a variety of non-logical
connectives, grammatically equivalent to the logical ones. The only one with a
well-understood meaning in tanru contexts is ``joi'', which is the kind of ``and'' that
denotes a mixture:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d20" name="e6d20">6.20)</a>    ti blanu joi xunre bolci
    This is-a-(blue and red) ball.
</pre>

    <p>The ball described is neither solely red nor solely blue, but probably striped or
    in some other way exhibiting a combination of the two colors. <a href=
    "#e6d20">Example 6.20</a> is distinct from:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d21" name="e6d21">6.21)</a>    ti blanu xunre bolci
    This is a bluish-red ball
</pre>which would be a ball whose color is some sort of purple tending toward red, since
``xunre'' is the more important of the two components. On the other hand,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d22" name="e6d22">6.22)</a>    ti blanu je xunre bolci
    This is a (blue and red) ball
</pre>is probably self-contradictory, seeming to claim that the ball is independently
both blu and red at the same time, although some sensible interpretation may exist.

    <p>Finally, just as English ``and'' has the variant form ``both ... and'', so ``je''
    between tanru components has the variant form ``gu'e ... gi'', where ``gu'e'' is
    placed before the components and ``gi'' between them:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d23" name="e6d23">6.23)</a>    gu'e barda gi xunre gerku
    (both big and red) type-of dog
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a>. For each logical
connective related to ``je'', there is a corresponding connective related to ``gu'e ...
gi'' in a systematic way.

    <p>The portion of a ``gu'e ... gi'' construction before the ``gi'' is a full selbri,
    and may use any of the selbri resources including ``je'' logical connections. After
    the ``gi'', logical connections are taken to be wider in scope than the ``gu'e ...
    gi'', which has in effect the same scope as ``bo'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e6d24" name="e6d24">6.23)</a>    gu'e barda je xunre gi gerku ja mlatu
    (both (big and red) and dog) or cat
    something which is either big, red, and a dog,
        or else a cat
</pre>leaves ``mlatu'' outside the ``gu'e--gi'' construction. The scope of the ``gi'' arm
extends only to a single brivla or to two or more brivla connected with ``bo'' or
``ke--ke'e''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s7" name="s7">7. Linked sumti: ``be--bei--be'o''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s7" name="s7">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s7" name="s7">The question of the place structures of selbri has been
    glossed over so far. This chapter does not attempt to treat place structure issues in
    detail; they are discussed in</a> <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>. One
    grammatical structure related to places belongs here, however. In simple sentences
    such as <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>, the place structure of the selbri is simply
    the defined place structure of the gismu ``mamta''. What about more complex
    selbri?</p>

    <p>For tanru, the place structure rule is simple: the place structure of a tanru is
    always the place structure of its tertau. Thus, the place structure of ``blanu
    zdani'' is that of ``zdani'': the x1 place is a house or nest, and the x2 place is
    its occupants.</p>

    <p>What about the places of ``blanu''? Is there any way to get them into the act? In
    fact, ``blanu'' has only one place, and this is merged, as it were, with the x1 place
    of ``zdani''. It is whatever is in the x1 place that is being characterized as
    blue-for-a-house. But if we replace ``blanu'' with ``xamgu'', we get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  ti xamgu zdani
    this is-a-good house.
    This is a good (for someone, by some standard) house.
</pre>

    <p>Since ``xamgu'' has three places (x1, the good thing; x2, the person for whom it
    is good; and x3, the standard of goodness), <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>
    necessarily omits information about the last two: there is no room for them. Room can
    be made, however!</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  ti xamgu be do bei mi [be'o] zdani
    this is-a-good ( for you by-standard me ) house.
    This is a house that is good for you by my standards.
</pre>Here, the gismu ``xamgu'' has been followed by the cmavo ``be'' (of selma'o BE),
which signals that one or more sumti follows. These sumti are not part of the overall
bridi place structure, but fill the places of the brivla they are attached to, starting
with x2. If there is more than one sumti, they are separated by the cmavo ``bei'' (of
selma'o BEI), and the list of sumti is terminated by the elidable terminator ``be'o'' (of
selma'o BEhO).

    <p>Grammatically, a brivla with sumti linked to it in this fashion plays the same
    role in tanru as a simple brivla. To illustrate, here is a fully fleshed-out version
    of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, with all places filled in:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  ti cmalu be le ka canlu

        and operated by the state.
</pre>

    <p>Here the three places of ``cmalu'', the three of ``nixli'', and the four of
    ``ckule'' are fully specified. Since the places of ``ckule'' are the places of the
    bridi as a whole, it was not necessary to link the sumti which follow ``ckule''. It
    would have been legal to do so, however:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  mi klama be le zarci bei le zdani [be'o]

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  mi klama le zarci le zdani
    I go to-the market from-the house.
</pre>No matter how complex a tanru gets, the last brivla always dictates the place
structure: the place structure of
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  melbi je cmalu nixli bo ckule
    a (pretty and little) (girl school)
    a school for girls which is both beautiful and small
</pre>is simply that of ``ckule''. (The sole exception to this rule is discussed in
<a href="#s8">Section 8</a>.)

    <p>It is possible to precede linked sumti by the place structure ordering tags
    ``fe'', ``fi'', ``fo'', and ``fu'' (of selma'o FA, discussed further in <a href=
    "chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>), which serve to explicitly specify the x2, x3, x4, and
    x5 places respectively. Normally, the place following the ``be'' is the x2 place and
    the other places follow in order. If it seems convenient to change the order,
    however, it can be accomplished as follows:</p>

</pre>which is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a>. Note that the
order of ``be'', ``bei'', and ``be'o'' does not change; only the inserted ``fi'' tells us
that ``mi'' is the x3 place (and correspondingly, the inserted ``fe'' tells us that
``do'' is the x2 place). Changing the order of sumti is often done to match the order of
another language, or for emphasis or rhythm.

    <p>Of course, using FA cmavo makes it easy to specify one place while omitting a
    previous place:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  ti xamgu be fi mi [be'o] zdani
    this is-a-good (by-standard me) house
    This is a good house by my standards.
</pre>Similarly, sumti labeled by modal or tense tags can be inserted into strings of
linked sumti just as they can into bridi:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d9" name="e7d9">7.9)</a>  ta blanu be ga'a mi [be'o] zdani
    That is-a-blue ( to-observer me ) house.
    That is a blue, as I see it, house.
</pre>

    <p>The meaning of <a href="#e7d9">Example 7.9</a> is slightly different from:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d10" name="e7d10">7.10)</a>    ta blanu zdani ga'a mi
    That is-a-blue house to-observer me.
    That is a blue house, as I see it.
</pre>

    <p>See discussions in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a> of modals and in <a href=
    "chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a> of tenses for more explanations.</p>

    <p>The terminator ``be'o'' is almost always elidable: however, if the selbri belongs
    to a description, then a relative clause following it will attach to the last linked
    sumti unless ``be'o'' is used, in which case it will attach to the outer
    description:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d11" name="e7d11">7.11)</a>    le xamgu be do noi barda cu zdani
    The good-thing for you (who are-large) is-a-house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d12" name="e7d12">7.12)</a> le xamgu be do be'o noi barda cu zdani
    The (good-thing for you) (which is-large) is-a-house
</pre>(Relative clauses are explained in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>.)

    <p>In other cases, however, ``be'o'' cannot be elided if ``ku'' has also been
    elided:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e7d13" name="e7d13">7.13)</a>    le xamgu be le ctuca [ku] be'o zdani
    the good (for the teacher ) house
</pre>requires either ``ku'' or ``be'o'', and since there is only one occurrence of
``be'', the ``be'o'' must match it, whereas it may be confusing which occurrence of
``le'' the ``ku'' terminates (in fact the second one is correct).

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s8" name="s8">8. Inversion of tanru: ``co''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s8" name="s8">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s8" name="s8">   co  CO  tanru inversion marker
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s8" name="s8">The standard order of Lojban tanru, whereby the modifier
precedes what it modifies, is very natural to English-speakers: we talk of ``blue
houses'', not of ``houses blue''. In other languages, however, such matters are
differently arranged, and Lojban supports this reverse order (tertau before seltau) by
inserting the particle ``co''.</a> <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> and <a href="#e8d2">
    Example 8.2</a> mean exactly the same thing:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  ta blanu zdani
    That is-a-blue type-of-house.
    That is a blue house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>   ta zdani co blanu
    That is-a-house of-type blue.
    That is a blue house.
</pre>This change is called ``tanru inversion''. In tanru inversion, the element before
``co'' (``zdani'' in <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a>) is the tertau, and the element
following ``co'' (``blanu'') in <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a>) is the seltau.

    <p>The meaning, and more specifically, the place structure, of a tanru is not
    affected by inversion: the place structure of ``zdani co blanu'' is still that of
    ``zdani''. However, the existence of inversion in a selbri has a very special effect
    on any sumti which follow that selbri. Instead of being interpreted as filling places
    of the selbri, they actually fill the places (starting with x2) of the seltau. In
    <a href="#s7">Section 7</a>, we saw how to fill interior places with ``be ... bei ...
    be'o'', and in fact <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> and <a href="#e8d4">Example
    8.4</a> have the same meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi klama be le zarci bei le zdani be'o
        troci
    I am-a-(goer to the market from the house)
        type-of trier.
    I try to go to the market from the house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>   mi troci co klama le zarci le zdani
    I am-a-trier
        of-type (goer to-the market from-the house).
    I try to go to the market from the house.
</pre><a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a> is a less deeply nested construction, requiring
fewer cmavo. As a result it is probably easier to understand.

    <p>Note that in Lojban ``trying to go'' is expressed using ``troci'' as the tertau.
    The reason is that ``trying to go'' is a ``going type of trying'', not a ``trying
    type of going''. The trying is more fundamental than the going --- if the attempt
    fails, we may not have a going at all.</p>

    <p>Any sumti which precede a selbri with an inverted tanru fill the places of the
    selbri (i.e., the places of the tertau) in the ordinary way. In <a href=
    "#e8d4">Example 8.4</a>, ``mi'' fills the x1 place of ``troci co klama'', which is
    the x1 place of ``troci''. The other places of the selbri remain unfilled. The
    trailing sumti ``le zarci'' and ``le zdani'' do not occupy selbri places, despite
    appearances.</p>

    <p>As a result, the regular mechanisms (involving selma'o VOhA and GOhI, explained in
    <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>) for referring to individual sumti of a bridi
    cannot refer to any of the trailing places of <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a>,
    because they are not really ``sumti of the bridi'' at all.</p>

    <p>When inverting a more complex tanru, it is possible to invert it only at the most
    general modifier-modified pair. The only possible inversion of <a href=
    "#e3d4">Example 3.4</a>, for instance, is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  ta nixli [bo] ckule co cmalu
    that (is-a-girl type-of school) of-type little.
    That's a girls' school which is small.
</pre>Note that the ``bo'' of <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> is optional in <a href=
"#e8d5">Example 8.5</a>, because ``co'' groups more loosely than any other cmavo used in
tanru, including none at all. Not even ``ke ... ke'e'' parentheses can encompass a
``co'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  ta cmalu ke nixli ckule [ke'e]
        co melbi
    that is-a-(little type-of (girl type-of school))
        of-type pretty.
    That's a small school for girls which is beautiful.
</pre>In <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a>, the ``ke'e'' is automatically inserted before
the ``co'' rather than at its usual place at the end of the selbri. As a result, there is
a simple and mechanical rule for removing ``co'' from any selbri: change ``A co B'' to
``ke B ke'e A''. (At the same time, any sumti following the selbri must be transformed
into ``be ... bei ... be'o'' form and attached following B.) Therefore,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  ckule co melbi nixli
    school of-type pretty girl
    school for beautiful girls
</pre>means the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  ke melbi nixli ke'e ckule
    ( pretty girl ) school
</pre>Multiple ``co'' cmavo can appear within a selbri, indicating multiple inversions: a
right-grouping rule is employed, as for ``bo''. The above rule can be applied to
interpret such selbri, but all ``co'' cmavo must be removed simultaneously:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  ckule co nixli co cmalu
    school of-type (girl of-type little)
</pre>becomes formally
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>    ke ke cmalu ke'e nixli ke'e ckule
    ( ( little ) girl ) school
</pre>which by the left-grouping rule is simply
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d11" name="e8d11">8.11)</a>    cmalu nixli ckule
    little girl school
    school for little girls
</pre>

    <p>As stated above, the selbri places, other than the first, of</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d12" name="e8d12">8.12)</a>    mi klama co sutra
    I am-a-goer of-type quick
    I go quickly
</pre>cannot be filled by placing sumti after the selbri, because any sumti in that
position fill the places of ``sutra'', the seltau. However, the tertau places (which
means in effect the selbri places) can be filled with ``be'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e8d13" name="e8d13">8.13)</a>    mi klama be le zarci co sutra
    I am-a-goer (to the store) of-type quick.

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s9" name="s9">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    kei KEI terminator for ``nu''
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s9" name="s9">So far we have only discussed brivla and tanru built up from
brivla as possible selbri. In fact, there are a few other constructions in Lojban which
are grammatically equivalent to brivla: they can be used either directly as selbri, or as
components in tanru. Some of these types of simple selbri are discussed at length in</a>
<a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>, and
<a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>; but for completeness these types are mentioned
here with a brief explanation and an example of their use in selbri.

    <p>The cmavo of selma'o GOhA (with one exception) serve as pro-bridi, providing a
    reference to the content of other bridi; none of them has a fixed meaning. The most
    commonly used member of GOhA is probably ``go'i'', which amounts to a repetition of
    the previous bridi, or part of it. If I say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  la djan. klama le zarci
    John goes-to the market.
</pre>you may retort:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  la djan. go'i troci
    John [repeat last] are-a-tryer
    John tries to.
</pre><a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> is short for:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  la djan. klama be le zarci be'o troci
    John is-a-goer (to the market) type-of trier.
</pre>because the whole bridi of <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> has been packaged up
into the single word ``go'i'' and inserted into <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>.

    <p>The exceptional member of GOhA is ``du'', which represents the relation of
    identity. Its place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...</dd>
    </dl>for as many places as are given. More information on selma'o GOhA is available
    in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>.

    <p>Lojban mathematical expressions (mekso) can be incorporated into selbri in two
    different ways. Mathematical operators such as ``su'i'', meaning ``plus'', can be
    transformed into selbri by prefixing them with ``nu'a'' (of selma'o NUhA). The
    resulting place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the result of applying (the operator) to arguments x2, x3, etc.</dd>
    </dl>for as many arguments as are required. (The result goes in the x1 place because
    the number of following places may be indefinite.) For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  li vo nu'a su'i li re li re
    The-number 4 is-the-sum-of the-number 2 and-the-number 2.
</pre>

    <p>A possible tanru example might be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  mi jimpe tu'a nu'a su'i nabmi
    I understand something-about the-mass-of is-the-sum-of problems.
    I understand addition problems.
</pre>More usefully, it is possible to combine a mathematical expression with a cmavo of
selma'o MOI to create one of various numerical selbri. Details are available in
    <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few tanru:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  la prim. palvr. pamoi cusku
    Preem Palver is-the-1-th speaker.
    Preem Palver is the first speaker.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  la an,iis. joi la .asun. bruna remei
    Anyi massed-with Asun are-a-brother type-of-twosome.
    Anyi and Asun are two brothers.
</pre>Finally, an important type of simple selbri which is not a brivla is the
abstraction. Grammatically, abstractions are simple: a cmavo of selma'o NU, followed by a
bridi, followed by the elidable terminator ``kei'' of selma'o KEI. Semantically,
abstractions are an extremely subtle and powerful feature of Lojban whose full
ramifications are documented in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>. A few examples:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  ti nu zdile kei kumfa
    This is-an-event-of amusement room.
    This is an amusement room.
</pre><a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> is quite distinct in meaning from:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  ti zdile kumfa
    This is-an-amuser room.
</pre>which suggests the meaning ``a room that amuses someone''.

    </dl>which is true of the thing, or things, that are the referents of the sumti, and

    the three noblest-governors
    the three kings
</pre>If these are understood to be the Three Kings of Christian tradition, who arrive
every year on January 6, then we may say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    la BALtazar. cu me le ci nolraitru
    Balthazar is one-of-the-referents-of ``the three kings''.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    la melxi,or. cu me le ci nolraitru
    Melchior is one of the three kings.
</pre>If the sumti refers to a single object, then the effect of ``me'' is much like that
of ``du'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    do du la djan.
    You are-identical-with the-one-called ``John''.

    You are-the-referent-of ``the-one-called `John'''.
    You are John.
</pre>It is common to use ``me'' selbri, especially those based on name sumti using
``la'', as seltau. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    ta me lai kraislr. [me'u] karce
    That (is-a-referent of ``the-mass-called `Chrysler''') car.
    That is a Chrysler car.
</pre>The elidable terminator ``me'u'' can usually be omitted. It is absolutely required
only if the ``me'' selbri is being used in an indefinite description (a type of sumti
explained in <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>), and if the indefinite description is
followed by a relative clause (explained in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>) or a
sumti logical connective (explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>). Without
a ``me'u'', the relative clause or logical connective would appear to belong to the sumti
embedded in the ``me'' expression. Here is a contrasting pair of sentences:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    re me le ci nolraitru .e la djan. [me'u] cu blabi
    Two of the group ``the three kings and John'' are white.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a> re me le ci nolraitru me'u .e la djan. cu blabi
    Two of the three kings, and John, are white.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> the ``me'' selbri covers the three kings plus
    John, and the indefinite description picks out two of them that are said to be white:
    we cannot say which two. In <a href="#e10d9">Example 10.9</a>, though, the ``me''
    selbri covers only the three kings: two of them are said to be white, and so is
    John.</p>

    <p>Finally, here is another example requiring ``me'u'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  ta me la'e le se cusku be do me'u cukta
    That  is-a-(what-you-said) type of book.
    That is the kind of book you were talking about.
</pre>

    <p>There are other sentences where either ``me'u'' or some other elidable terminator
    must be expressed:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>  le me le ci nolraitru [ku] me'u nunsalci
    the (the three kings) type-of-event-of-celebrating
    the Three Kings celebration
</pre>requires either ``ku'' or ``me'u'' to be explicit, and (as with ``be'o'' in
    <a href="#s7">Section 7</a>) the ``me'u'' leaves no doubt which cmavo it is paired
    with.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s11" name="s11">11. Conversion of simple selbri</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s11" name="s11">Conversion is the process of changing a selbri so that its
    places appear in a different order. This is not the same as labeling the sumti with
    the cmavo of FA, as mentioned in</a> <a href="#s7">Section 7</a>, and then
    rearranging the order in which the sumti are spoken or written. Conversion transforms
    the selbri into a distinct, though closely related, selbri with renumbered
    places.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, conversion is accomplished by placing a cmavo of selma'o SE before the
    selbri:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    mi prami do
    I love you.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    do se prami mi
    You [swap x1 and x2] love me.
    You are loved by me.
</pre>

    <p>Conversion is fully explained in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>. For the
    purposes of this chapter, the important point about conversion is that it applies
    only to the following simple selbri. When trying to convert a tanru, therefore, it is
    necessary to be careful! Consider <a href="#e11d3">Example 11.3</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    la .alis. cu cadzu klama le zarci
    Alice is-a-walker type-of goer to-the market.
    Alice walkingly goes to the market.
    Alice walks to the market.
</pre>

    <p>To convert this sentence so that ``le zarci'' is in the x1 place, one correct way
    is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    le zarci cu se ke cadzu klama [ke'e] la .alis.
    The market is-a-[swap x1/x2] ( walker type-of goer) Alice.
    The market is-walkingly gone-to by-Alice.
</pre>The ``ke ... ke'e'' brackets cause the entire tanru to be converted by the ``se'',
which would otherwise convert only ``cadzu'', leading to:
    <pre>

        klama la .alis.
    The market (is-a-[swap x1/x2] walker)
        type-of goer to Alice.
    The market is-a-walking-surface type-of goer to Alice.
</pre>whatever that might mean. An alternative approach, since the place structure of
``cadzu klama'' is that of ``klama'' alone, is to convert only the latter:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    le zarci cu cadzu se klama la .alis.
    The market walkingly is-gone-to by-Alice.
</pre>

    <p>But the tanru in <a href="#e11d6">Example 11.6</a> may or may not have the same
    meaning as that in <a href="#e11d3">Example 11.3</a>; in particular, because
    ``cadzu'' is not converted, there is a suggestion that although Alice is the goer,
    the market is the walker. With a different sumti as x1, this seemingly odd
    interpretation might make considerable sense:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a>    la djan. cu cadzu se klama la .alis
    John walkingly is-gone-to by Alice
</pre>suggests that Alice is going to John, who is a moving target.

    <p>There is an alternative type of conversion, using the cmavo ``jai'' of selma'o JAI
    optionally followed by a modal or tense construction. Grammatically, such a
    combination behaves exactly like conversion using SE. More details can be found in
    <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s12" name="s12">12. Scalar negation of selbri</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s12" name="s12">Negation is too large and complex a topic to explain fully
    in this chapter; see</a> <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>. In brief, there are
    two main types of negation in Lojban. This section is concerned with so-called
    ``scalar negation'', which is used to state that a true relation between the sumti is
    something other than what the selbri specifies. Scalar negation is expressed by cmavo
    of selma'o NAhE:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    la .alis. cu na'e ke cadzu klama [ke'e] le zarci
    Alice non- (walkingly goes) to-the market.
    Alice other-than (walkingly goes) to-the market.
    Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>meaning that Alice's relationship to the market is something other than that of
walking there. But if the ``ke'' were omitted, the result would be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la .alis. cu na'e cadzu klama le zarci
    Alice non- walkingly goes to-the market.
    Alice doesn't walk to the market.
</pre>meaning that Alice does go there in some way (``klama'' is not negated), but by a
means other than that of walking. <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> negates both
``cadzu'' and ``klama'', suggesting that Alice's relation to the market is something
different from walkingly-going; it might be walking without going, or going without
walking, or neither.

    <p>Of course, any of the simple selbri types explained in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>
    may be used in place of brivla in any of these examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    la djonz. cu na'e pamoi cusku
    Jones is non-1st speaker
    Jones is not the first speaker.
</pre>

    <p>Since only ``pamoi'' is negated, an appropriate inference is that he is some other
    kind of speaker.</p>

    <p>Here is an assortment of more complex examples showing the interaction of scalar
    negation with ``bo'' grouping, ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' grouping, logical connection, and
    sumti linked with ``be'' and ``bei'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        klama le zarci
    I ((non-quickly) ( walking using the arms))
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, walking using my arms
        other than quickly.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a>, ``na'e'' negates only ``sutra''. Contrast
    <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a>    mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        klama le zarci
    I non- ( quickly (walking using the arms) )
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, other than by walking
        quickly on my arms.
</pre>

    <p>Now consider <a href="#e12d6">Example 12.6</a> and <a href="#e12d7">Example
    12.7</a>, which are equivalent in meaning, but use ``ke'' grouping and ``bo''
    grouping respectively:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    mi sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o je masno
        klama le zarci
    I (quickly -- (walking using the arms) and slowly)
        go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both quickly walking
        using my arms and slowly.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a> mi ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        je masno klama le zarci
    I ((quickly (walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both quickly walking
        using my arms and slowly.
</pre>

    <p>However, if we place a ``na'e'' at the beginning of the selbri in both <a href=
    "#e12d6">Example 12.6</a> and <a href="#e12d7">Example 12.7</a>, we get different
    results:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d8" name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    mi na'e sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        je masno klama le zarci
    I ((non- quickly) -- (walking using the arms)
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both walking using my arms
        other than quickly, and also slowly.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d9" name="e12d9">12.9)</a> mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka [be'o] ke'e
        je masno klama le zarci
    I (non-(quickly (walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to the market.
    I go to the market, both other than quickly
        walking using my arms, and also slowly.
</pre>

    <p>The difference arises because the ``na'e'' in <a href="#e12d9">Example 12.9</a>
    negates the whole construction from ``ke'' to ``ke'e'', whereas in <a href=
    "#e12d8">Example 12.8</a> it negates ``sutra'' alone.</p>

    <p>Beware of omitting terminators in these complex examples! If the explicit ``ke'e''
    is left out in <a href="#e12d9">Example 12.9</a>, it is transformed into:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d10" name="e12d10">12.10)</a>  mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka be'o
        je masno klama [ke'e] le zarci
    I non-(quickly ((walking using the arms))
        and slowly) go-to) the market.
    I do something other than quickly both
        going to the market walking using my arms
        and slowly going to the market.
</pre>

    <p>And if both ``ke'e'' and ``be'o'' are omitted, the results are even sillier:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e12d11" name="e12d11">12.11)</a>  mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be fi le birka
        je masno klama [be'o] [ke'e] le zarci
    I non-(quickly walk on my (arm-type
        and slow) goers) on the market.
    I do something other than quickly walking using the
        goers, both arm-type and slow, relative-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e12d11">Example 12.11</a>, everything after ``be'' is a linked sumti,
    so the place structure is that of ``cadzu'', whose x2 place is the surface walked
    upon. It is less than clear what an ``arm-type goer'' might be. Furthermore, since
    the x3 place has been occupied by the linked sumti, the ``le zarci'' following the
    selbri falls into the nonexistent x4 place of ``cadzu''. As a result, the whole
    example, though grammatical, is complete nonsense. (The bracketed Lojban words appear
    where a fluent Lojbanist would understand them to be implied.)</p>

    <p>Finally, it is also possible to place ``na'e'' before a ``gu'e ... gi'' logically
    connected tanru construction. The meaning of this usage has not yet been firmly
    established.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s13" name="s13">13. Tenses and bridi negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s13" name="s13">A bridi can have cmavo associated with it which specify the
    time, place, or mode of action. For example, in</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s13" name="s13"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
    I [past] go to-the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>the cmavo ``pu'' specifies that the action of the speaker going to the market takes
place in the past. Tenses are explained in full detail in <a href=
"chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>. Tense is semantically a property of the entire bridi;
however, the usual syntax for tenses attaches them at the front of the selbri, as in
<a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a>. There are alternative ways of expressing tense
information as well. Modals, which are explained in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
9</a>, behave in the same way as tenses.

    <p>Similarly, a bridi may have the particle ``na'' (of selma'o NA) attached to the
    beginning of the selbri to negate the bridi. A negated bridi expresses what is false
    without saying anything about what is true. Do not confuse this usage with the scalar
    negation of <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    la djonz. na pamoi cusku
    Jones (Not!) is-the-first speaker
    It is not true that Jones is the first speaker.
    Jones isn't the first speaker.
</pre>

    <p>Jones may be the second speaker, or not a speaker at all; <a href="#e13d2">Example
    13.2</a> doesn't say. There are other ways of expressing bridi negation as well; the
    topic is explained fully in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>.</p>

    <p>Various combinations of tense and bridi negation cmavo are permitted. If both are
    expressed, either order is permissible with no change in meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e13d3" name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    mi na pu klama le zarci
    mi pu na klama le zarci
    It is false that I went to the market.
    I didn't go to the market.
</pre>It is also possible to have more than one ``na'', in which case pairs of ``na''
cmavo cancel out:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e13d4" name="e13d4">13.4)</a>    mi na na klama le zarci
    It is false that it is false that I go to the market.
    I go to the market.
</pre>It is even possible, though somewhat pointless, to have multiple ``na'' cmavo and
tense cmavo mixed together, subject to the limitation that two adjacent tense cmavo will
be understood as a compound tense, and must fit the grammar of tenses as explained in
<a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-e13d5" name="e13d5">13.5)</a>    mi na pu na ca klama le zarci
    I [not] [past]
        [not] [present] go to-the market
    It is not the case that in the past it was not
        the case that in the present I went
        to the market.
    I didn't not go to the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>Tense, modal, and negation cmavo can appear only at the beginning of the selbri.
They cannot be embedded within it.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s14" name="s14">14. Some types of asymmetrical tanru</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s14" name="s14">This section and</a> <a href="#s15">Section 15</a> contain
    some example tanru classified into groups based on the type of relationship between
    the modifying seltau and the modified tertau. All the examples are paralleled by
    compounds actually observed in various natural languages. In the tables which follow,
    each group is preceded by a brief explanation of the relationship. The tables
    themselves contain a tanru, a literal gloss, an indication of the languages which
    exhibit a compound analogous to this tanru, and (for those tanru with no English
    parallel) a translation.</p>

    <p>Here are the 3-letter abbreviations used for the various languages (it is presumed
    to be obvious whether a compound is found in English or not, so English is not
    explicitly noted):</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>Aba = Abazin Chi = Chinese Eng = English Ewe = Ewe Fin = Finnish Geo = Georgian
      Gua = Guarani Hop = Hopi Hun = Hungarian Imb = Imbabura Quechua Kar = Karaitic Kaz
      = Kazakh Kor = Korean Mon = Mongolian Qab = Qabardian Que = Quechua Rus = Russian
      Skt = Sanskrit Swe = Swedish Tur = Turkish Udm = Udmurt</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Any lujvo or fu'ivla used in a group are glossed at the end of that group.</p>

    <p>The tanru discussed in this section are asymmetrical tanru; that is, ones in which
    the order of the terms is fundamental to the meaning of the tanru. For example,
    ``junla dadylsi'', or ``clock pendulum'', is the kind of pendulum used in a clock,
    whereas ``dadysli junla'', or ``pendulum clock'', is the kind of clock that employs a
    pendulum. Most tanru are asymmetrical in this sense. Symmetrical tanru are discussed
    in <a href="#s15">Section 15</a>.</p>

    <p>The tertau represents an action, and the seltau then represents the object of that
    action:</p>

    <dl>

      nunkalte = event-of-hunting terkavbu = trap zerle'a = crime-taker nunte'a =
      event-of-fearing</dd>
    </dl>The tertau represents a set, and the seltau the type of the elements contained
    in that set:

    <dl>

      cevni prenu god folk (Skt) lijgri = line-group lamgri = adjacent-group mulgri =
      complete-group cpami'i = pull-machine</dd>
    </dl>Conversely: the tertau is an element, and the seltau represents a set in which
    that element is contained. Implicitly, the meaning of the tertau is restricted from
    its usual general meaning to the specific meaning appropriate for elements in the
    given set. Note the opposition between ``zdani linji'' in the previous group, and
    ``linji zdani'' in this one, which shows why this kind of tanru is called
    ``asymmetrical''.

      <dd>raindrop (Tur,Kor,Hun,Udm,Aba) linji zdani row house</dd>
    </dl>The seltau specifies an object and the tertau a component or detail of that

    </dl>Conversely: the seltau specifies a characteristic or important detail of the

      terkakpa = source of digging</dd>
    </dl>The tertau specifies an object, and the seltau specifies the material from which
    the object is made. This case is especially interesting, because the referent of the
    tertau may normally be made from just one kind of material, which is then overridden
    in the tanru.

      <dd>glass (eye shape) = glass eye blaci kanla bo sidju glass (eye helper) =
      spectacles</dd>
    </dl>The tertau specifies a typical object used to measure a quantity and the seltau
    specifies something measured. The tanru as a whole refers to a given quantity of the
    thing being measured. English does not have compounds of this form, as a rule.

      calkyguzme = shell-fruit, calabash</dd>
    </dl>The tertau specifies an object with certain implicit properties, and the seltau
    overrides one of those implicit properties:

    <dl>
      <dt>kensa bloti</dt>

      <dd>spaceship bakni verba cattle child (Ewe = calf)</dd>
    </dl>The seltau specifies a whole, and the tertau specifies a part which normally is
    associated with a different whole. The tanru then refers to a part of the seltau
    which stands in the same relationship to the whole seltau as the tertau stands to its
    typical whole.

    </dl>

    <p>It is clear that ``tooth'' is being specified, and that ``milk'' and ``eye'' act
    as modifiers. However, the relationship between ``ladru'' and ``denci'' is something
    like ``tooth which one has when one is drinking milk from one's mother'', a
    relationship certainly present nowhere except in this particular concept. As for
    ``kanla denci'', the relationship is not only not present on the surface, it is
    hardly possible to formulate it at all.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s15" name="s15">This section deals with symmetrical tanru, where order is
    not important. Many of these tanru can be expressed with a logical or non-logical
    connective between the components.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s15" name="s15">The tanru may refer to things which are correctly specified
    by both tanru components. Some of these instances may also be seen as asymmetrical
    tanru where the seltau specifies a material. The connective ``je'' is
    appropriate:</a></p>

      tolvri = opposite-of-brave</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s15" name="s15">The tanru may refer to all things which are specified by
    either of the tanru components. The connective ``ja'' is appropriate:</a>

    <dl>
      <dt>nunji'a nunterji'a</dt>

      <dd>victory defeat (Skt = victory or defeat) donri nicte day night (Skt = day and

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s16" name="s16">16. ``Pretty little girls' school'': forty ways to say
    it</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s16" name="s16">The following examples show every possible grouping
    arrangement of ``melbi cmalu nixli ckule'' using ``bo'' or ``ke ... ke'e'' for
    grouping and ``je'' or ``jebo'' for logical connection. Most of these are definitely
    not plausible interpretations of the English phrase ``pretty little girls' school'',
    especially those which describe something which is both a girl and a school.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s16" name="s16">Examples 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 5.6 are repeated here as
    Examples 16.1, 16.9, 16.17, 16.25, and 16.33 respectively. The seven examples
    following each of these share the same grouping pattern, but differ in the presence
    or absence of ``je'' at each possible site. Some of the examples have more than one
    Lojban version. In that case, they differ only in grouping mechanism, and are always
    equivalent in meaning.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s16" name="s16">The logical connective ``je'' is associative: that is, ``A
    and (B and C)'' is the same as ``(A and B) and C''. Therefore, some of the examples
    have the same meaning as others. In particular, 16.8, 16.16, 16.24, 16.32, and 16.40
    all have the same meaning because all four brivla are logically connected and the
    grouping is simply irrelevant. Other equivalent forms are noted in the examples
    themselves. However, if ``je'' were replaced by ``naja'' or ``jo'' or most of the
    other logical connectives, the meanings would become distinct.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-5-s16" name="s16">It must be emphasized that, because of the ambiguity of all
    tanru, the English translations are by no means definitive --- they represent only
    one possible interpretation of the corresponding Lojban sentence.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s1" name="s1">If you understand anything about Lojban, you know what a
    sumti is by now, right? An argument, one of those things that fills the places of
    simple Lojban sentences like:</a></p>

    I go-to the market
</pre>In <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>, ``mi'' and ``le zarci'' are the sumti. It is
easy to see that these two sumti are not of the same kind: ``mi'' is a pro-sumti (the
Lojban analogue of a pronoun) referring to the speaker, whereas ``le zarci'' is a
description which refers to something described as being a market.

    <p>There are five kinds of simple sumti provided by Lojban:</p>

      <dd>descriptions like ``le zarci'', which usually begin with a descriptor (called a

    <p>Most of this chapter is about descriptions, as they have the most complicated
    syntax and usage. Some attention is also given to names, which are closely interwoven
    with descriptions. Pro-sumti, numbers, and quotations are described in more detail in
    <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>, <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>, and
    <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a> respectively, so this chapter only gives
    summaries of their forms and uses. See <a href="#s13">Section 13</a> through <a href=
    "#s15">Section 15</a> for these summaries.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s2" name="s2">2. The three basic description types</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s2" name="s2">   le  LE  the, the one(s) described as
    lo  LE  some, some of those which really are
    la  LA  the one(s) named
    ku  KU  elidable terminator for LE, LA
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s2" name="s2">The syntax of descriptions is fairly complex, and not all of
it can be explained within the confines of this chapter: relative clauses, in particular,
are discussed in</a> <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>. However, most descriptions
have just two components: a descriptor belonging to selma'o LE or LA, and a selbri. (The
difference between selma'o LE and selma'o LA is not important until <a href=
"#s12">Section 12</a>.) Furthermore, the selbri is often just a single brivla. Here is an
elementary example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  le zarci
    one-or-more-specific-things-each-of-which-
        I-describe-as being-a-market
    the market
</pre>The long gloss for ``le'' is of course far too long to use most of the time, and in
fact ``le'' is quite close in meaning to English ``the''. It has particular implications,
however, which ``the'' does not have.

    <p>The general purpose of all descriptors is to create a sumti which might occur in
    the x1 place of the selbri belonging to the description. Thus ``le zarci'' conveys
    something which might be found in the x1 place of ``zarci'', namely a market.</p>

    <p>The specific purpose of ``le'' is twofold. First, it indicates that the speaker
    has one or more specific markets in mind (whether or not the listener knows which
    ones they are). Second, it also indicates that the speaker is merely describing the
    things he or she has in mind as markets, without being committed to the truth of that
    description.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  le zarci
        cu barda
    one-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as ``markets''
        is/are-big.
    The market is big.
    The markets are big.
</pre>Note that English-speakers must state whether a reference to markets is to just one
(``the market'') or to more than one (``the markets''). Lojban requires no such forced
choice, so both colloquial translations of <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a> are valid.
Only the context can specify which is meant. (This rule does not mean that Lojban has no
way of specifying the number of markets in such a case: that mechanism is explained in
<a href="#s7">Section 7</a>.)

    <p>Now consider the following strange-looking example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  le nanmu cu ninmu
    one-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe as ``men''
        are women
    The man is a woman.
    The men are women.
</pre><a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> is not self-contradictory in Lojban, because ``le
nanmu'' merely means something or other which, for my present purposes, I choose to
describe as a man, whether or not it really is a man. A plausible instance would be:
someone we had assumed to be a man at a distance turned out to be actually a woman on
closer observation. <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> is what I would say to point out my
observation to you.

    <p>In all descriptions with ``le'', the listener is presumed to either know what I
    have in mind or else not to be concerned at present (perhaps I will give more
    identifying details later). In particular, I might be pointing at the supposed man or
    men: <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> would then be perfectly intelligible, since ``le
    nanmu'' merely clarifies that I am pointing at the supposed man, not at a landscape,
    or a nose, which happens to lie in the same direction.</p>

    <p>The second descriptor dealt with in this section is ``lo''. Unlike ``le'', ``lo''
    is nonspecific:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  lo zarci
    one-or-more-of-all-the-things-which-really are-markets
    a market
    some markets
</pre>Again, there are two colloquial English translations. The effect of using ``lo'' in
<a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> is to refer generally to one or more markets, without
being specific about which. Unlike ``le zarci'', ``lo zarci'' must refer to something
which actually is a market (that is, which can appear in the x1 place of a truthful bridi
whose selbri is ``zarci''). Thus

    <dl>
      <dt>2.5</dt>

      <dd>lo nanmu cu ninmu Some man is a woman. Some men are women.</dd>
    </dl>must be false in Lojban, given that there are no objects in the real world which
    are both men and women. Pointing at some specific men or women would not make
    <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> true, because those specific individuals are no more
    both-men-and-women than any others. In general, ``lo'' refers to whatever individuals
    meet its description.

    <p>The last descriptor of this section is ``la'', which indicates that the selbri
    which follows it has been dissociated from its normal meaning and is being used as a
    name. Like ``le'' descriptions, ``la'' descriptions are implicitly restricted to
    those I have in mind. (Do not confuse this use of ``la'' with its use before regular
    Lojbanized names, which is discussed in <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>.) For
    example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  la cribe pu finti le lisri
    the-one-named ``bear'' [past] creates the story.
    Bear wrote the story.
</pre>In <a href="#e2d6">Example 2.6</a>, ``la cribe'' refers to someone whose naming
predicate is ``cribe'', i.e. ``Bear''. In English, most names don't mean anything, or at
least not anything obvious. The name ``Frank'' coincides with the English word ``frank'',
meaning ``honest'', and so one way of translating ``Frank ate some cheese'' into Lojban
would be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  la stace pu citka lo cirla
    The-one-called ``Honest/Frank'' [past] eats some cheese.
</pre>

    <p>English-speakers typically would not do this, as we tend to be more attached to
    the sound of our names than their meaning, even if the meaning (etymological or
    current) is known. Speakers of other languages may feel differently. (In point of
    fact, ``Frank'' originally meant ``the free one'' rather than ``the honest
    one''.)</p>

    <p>It is important to note the differences between <a href="#e2d6">Example 2.6</a>
    and the following:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  le cribe pu finti le lisri
    One-or-more-specific-things-which-I-describe-as a-bear
        [past] creates the story.
    The bear(s) wrote the story.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>  lo cribe pu finti le lisri
    One-or-more-of-the-things-which-really are-bears
        [past] creates the story.
    A bear wrote the story.
    Some bears wrote the story.
</pre><a href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a> is about a specific bear or bearlike thing(s), or
thing(s) which the speaker (perhaps whimsically or metaphorically) describes as a bear
(or more than one); <a href="#e2d9">Example 2.9</a> is about one or more of the really
existing, objectively defined bears. In either case, though, each of them must have
contributed to the writing of the story, if more than one bear (or ``bear'') is meant.

    <p>(The notion of a ``really existing, objectively defined bear'' raises certain
    difficulties. Is a panda bear a ``real bear''? How about a teddy bear? In general,
    the answer is ``yes''. Lojban gismu are defined as broadly as possible, allowing
    tanru and lujvo to narrow down the definition. There probably are no necessary and
    sufficient conditions for defining what is and what is not a bear that can be pinned
    down with complete precision: the real world is fuzzy. In borderline cases, ``le''
    may communicate better than ``lo''.)</p>

    <p>So while <a href="#e2d6">Example 2.6</a> could easily be true (there is a real
    writer named ``Greg Bear''), and <a href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a> could be true if the
    speaker is sufficiently peculiar in what he or she describes as a bear, <a href=
    "#e2d9">Example 2.9</a> is certainly false.</p>

    <p>Similarly, compare the following two examples, which are analogous to <a href=
    "#e2d8">Example 2.8</a> and <a href="#e2d9">Example 2.9</a> respectively:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d10" name="e2d10">2.10)</a>    le remna pu finti le lisri
    The human being(s) wrote the story.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e2d11" name="e2d11">2.11)</a> lo remna pu finti le lisri
    A human being wrote the story.
    Some human beings wrote the story.
</pre><a href="#e2d10">Example 2.10</a> says who the author of the story is: one or more
particular human beings that the speaker has in mind. If the topic of conversation is the
story, then <a href="#e2d10">Example 2.10</a> identifies the author as someone who can be
pointed out or who has been previously mentioned; whereas if the topic is a person, then
``le remna'' is in effect a shorthand reference to that person. <a href="#e2d11">Example
2.11</a> merely says that the author is human.

    <p>The elidable terminator for all descriptions is ``ku''. It can almost always be
    omitted with no danger of ambiguity. The main exceptions are in certain uses of
    relative clauses, which are discussed in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>, and
    in the case of a description immediately preceding the selbri. In this latter case,
    using an explicit ``cu'' before the selbri makes the ``ku'' unnecessary. There are
    also a few other uses of ``ku'': in the compound negator ``naku'' (discussed in
    <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>) and to terminate place-structure, tense, and
    modal tags that do not have associated sumti (discussed in <a href=
    "chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a> and <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>).</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s3" name="s3">3. Individuals and masses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s3" name="s3">   lei LE  the mass I describe as
    loi LE  part of the mass of those which really are
    lai LA  the mass of those named
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s3" name="s3">All Lojban sumti are classified by whether they refer to one
of three types of objects, known as ``individuals'', ``masses'', and ``sets''. The term
``individual'' is misleading when used to refer to more than one object, but no
less-confusing term has as yet been found. All the descriptions in</a> <a href=
"#s1">Sections 1</a> and <a href="#s2">2</a> refer to individuals, whether one or more
than one. Consider the following example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  le prenu cu bevri le pipno
    One-or-more-of-those-I-describe-as persons
        carry the piano.
    The person(s) carry the piano.
</pre>(Of course the second ``le'' should really get the same translation as the first,
but I am putting the focus of this discussion on the first ``le'', the one preceding
``prenu''. I will assume that there is only one piano under discussion.)

    <p>Suppose the context of <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> is such that you can
    determine that I am talking about three persons. What am I claiming? I am claiming
    that each of the three persons carried the piano. This claim can be true if the
    persons carried the piano one at a time, or in turns, or in a variety of other ways.
    But in order for <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> to be true, I must be willing to
    assert that person 1 carried the piano, and that person 2 carried the piano, and that
    person 3 carried the piano.</p>

    <p>But suppose I am not willing to claim that. For in fact pianos are heavy, and very
    few persons can carry a piano all by themselves. The most likely factual situation is
    that person 1 carried one end of the piano, and person 2 the other end, while person
    3 either held up the middle or else supervised the whole operation without actually
    lifting anything. The correct way of expressing such a situation in Lojban is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  lei prenu cu bevri le pipno
    The-mass-of-one-or-more-of-those-I-describe-as persons
        carry the piano.
</pre>Here the same three persons are treated not as individuals, but as a so-called
``mass entity'', or just ``mass''. A mass has the properties of each individual which
composes it, and may have other properties of its own as well. This can lead to apparent
contradictions. Thus suppose in the piano-moving example above that person 1 has fair
skin, whereas person 2 has dark skin. Then it is correct to say that the person-mass has
both fair skin and dark skin. Using the mass descriptor ``lei'' signals that ordinary
logical reasoning is not applicable: contradictions can be maintained, and all sorts of
other peculiarities may exist. However, we can safely say that a mass inherits only the
component properties that are relevant to it; it would be ludicrous to say that a mass of
two persons is of molecular dimensions, simply because some of the parts (namely, the
molecules) of the persons are that small.

    <p>The descriptors ``loi'' and ``lai'' are analogous to ``lo'' and ``la''
    respectively, but refer to masses either by property (``loi'') or by name (``lai'').
    A classic example of ``loi'' use is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  loi cinfo cu xabju le fi'ortu'a
    part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really are-lions
        dwell in-the African-land.
    The lion dwells in Africa.
    Lions dwell in Africa.
</pre>The difference between ``lei'' and ``loi'' is that ``lei cinfo'' refers to a mass
of specific individuals which the speaker calls lions, whereas ``loi cinfo'' refers to
some part of the mass of all those individuals which actually are lions. The restriction
to ``some part of the mass'' allows statements like <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> to be
true even though some lions do not dwell in Africa --- they live in various zoos around
the world. On the other hand, <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> doesn't actually say that
most lions live in Africa: equally true is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  loi glinanmu cu xabju le fi'ortu'a
    part-of-the-mass-of-those-which-really are-English-men
        dwell in-the African-land.
    The Englishman dwells in Africa.
</pre>since there is at least one Englishman living there. <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>
explains another method of saying what is usually meant by ``The lion lives in Africa''
which does imply that living in Africa is normal, not exceptional, for lions.

    <p>Note that the Lojban mass articles are sometimes translated by English plurals
    (the most usual case), sometimes by English singulars (when the singular is used to
    express typicalness or abstraction), and sometimes by singulars with no article:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  loi matne cu ranti
    part-of-the-mass-of-that-which-really
        is-a-quantity-of-butter is-soft.
    Butter is soft.
</pre>Of course, some butter is hard (for example, if it is frozen butter), so the
``part-of'' implication of ``loi'' becomes once again useful. The reason this mechanism
works is that the English words like ``butter'', which are seen as already describing
masses, are translated in Lojban by non- mass forms. The place structure of ``matne'' is
``x1 is a quantity of butter from source x2'', so the single English word ``butter'' is
translated as something like ``a part of the mass formed from all the quantities of
butter that exist''. (Note that the operation of forming a mass entity does not imply, in
Lojban, that the components of the mass are necessarily close to one another or even
related in any way other than conceptually. Masses are formed by the speaker's intention
to form a mass, and can in principle contain anything.)

    <p>The mass name descriptor ``lai'' is used in circumstances where we wish to talk
    about a mass of things identified by a name which is common to all of them. It is not
    used to identify a mass by a single name peculiar to it. Thus the mass version of
    <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a>,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  lai cribe pu finti
        le vi cukta
    the-mass-of-those-named ``bear'' [past] creates
        the nearby book.
    The Bears wrote this book.
</pre>in a context where ``la cribe'' would be understood as plural, would mean that
either Tom Bear or Fred Bear (to make up some names) might have written the book, or that
Tom and Fred might have written it as collaborators. Using ``la'' instead of ``lai'' in
<a href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a> would give the implication that each of Tom and Fred,
considered individually, had written it.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s4" name="s4">4. Masses and sets</a></h2>

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s4" name="s4">Having said so much about masses, let us turn to sets. Sets
are easier to understand than masses, but are more rarely used. Like a mass, a set is an
abstract object formed from a number of individuals; however, the properties of a set are
not derived from any of the properties of the individuals that compose it.</a>

    <p>Sets have properties like cardinality (how many elements in the set), membership
    (the relationship between a set and its elements), and set inclusion (the
    relationship between two sets, one of which --- the superset -- contains all the
    elements of the other --- the subset). The set descriptors ``le'i'', ``lo'i'' and
    ``la'i'' correspond exactly to the mass descriptors ``lei'', ``loi'', and ``lai''
    except that normally we talk of the whole of a set, not just part of it. Here are
    some examples contrasting ``lo'', ``loi'', and ``lo'i'':</p>
    <pre>

    There are a lot of rats.
</pre>

    <p>The mass of rats is small because at least one rat is small; the mass of rats is
    also large; the set of rats, though, is unquestionably large -- it has billions of
    members. The mass of rats is also brown, since some of its components are; but it
    would be incorrect to call the set of rats brown --- brown-ness is not the sort of
    property that sets possess.</p>

    <p>Lojban speakers should generally think twice before employing the set descriptors.
    However, certain predicates have places that require set sumti to fill them. For
    example, the place structure of ``fadni'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is ordinary/common/typical/usual in property x2 among the members of set
      x3</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Why is it necessary for the x3 place of ``fadni'' to be a set? Because it makes no
    sense for an individual to be typical of another individual: an individual is typical
    of a group. In order to make sure that the bridi containing ``fadni'' is about an
    entire group, its x3 place must be filled with a set:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  mi fadni fi lo'i lobypli
    I am-ordinary among the-set-of Lojban-users.
    I am a typical Lojban user.
</pre>

    <p>Note that the x2 place has been omitted; I am not specifying in exactly which way
    I am typical --- whether in language knowledge, or age, or interests, or something
    else. If ``lo'i'' were changed to ``lo'' in <a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a>, the
    meaning would be something like ``I am typical of some Lojban user'', which is
    nonsense.</p>

residence (Africa), a diet (game), and so on. Likewise we can say that
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  lo'e glinanmu cu xabju le fi'ortu'a
        na.e le gligugde
    The-typical English-man dwells-in the African-land
        (Not!) and the English-country.
    The typical Englishman dwells not in Africa
        but in England.
</pre>The relationship between ``lo'e cinfo'' and ``lo'i cinfo'' may be explained thus:
the typical lion is an imaginary lion-abstraction which best exemplifies the set of
lions. There is a similar relationship between ``le'e'' and ``le'i'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  le'e xelso merko
        cu gusta ponse
    The-stereotypical Greek-type-of American
        is-a-restaurant-type-of owner.
    Lots of Greek-Americans own restaurants.
</pre>Here we are concerned not with the actual set of Greek-Americans, but with the set
of those the speaker has in mind, which is typified by one (real or imaginary) who owns a
restaurant. The word ``stereotypical'' is often derogatory in English, but ``le'e'' need
not be derogatory in Lojban: it simply suggests that the example is typical in the
speaker's imagination rather than in some objectively agreed-upon way. Of course,
different speakers may disagree about what the features of ``the typical lion'' are (some
would include having a short intestine, whereas others would know nothing of lions'
intestines), so the distinction between ``lo'e cinfo'' and ``le'e cinfo'' may be very
fine.

    <p>Furthermore,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  le'e skina cu se finti ne'i la xali,uyd.
    The-stereotypical movie is-invented in Hollywood.
</pre>is probably true to an American, but might be false (not the stereotype) to someone
living in India or Russia.

    <p>Note that there is no naming equivalent of ``lo'e'' and ``le'e'', because there is
    no need, as a rule, for a ``typical George'' or a ``typical Smith''. People or things
    who share a common name do not, in general, have any other common attributes worth
    mentioning.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s6" name="s6">6. Quantified sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s6" name="s6">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s6" name="s6">   ro  PA  all of/each of
    su'o    PA  at least (one of)
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s6" name="s6">Quantifiers tell us how many: in the case of quantifiers with
sumti, how many things we are talking about. In Lojban, quantifiers are expressed by
numbers and mathematical expressions: a large topic discussed in some detail in</a>
<a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, a simplified
treatment will suffice. Our examples will employ either the simple Lojban numbers ``pa'',
``re'', ``ci'', ``vo'', and ``mu'', meaning ``one'', ``two'', ``three'', ``four'',
``five'' respectively, or else one of four special quantifiers, two of which are
discussed in this section and listed above. These four quantifiers are important because
every Lojban sumti has either one or two of them implicitly present in it --- which one
or two depends on the particular kind of sumti. There is more explanation of implicit
quantifiers later in this section. (The other two quantifiers, ``piro'' and ``pisu'o'',
are explained in <a href="#s7">Section 7</a>.)

    <p>Every Lojban sumti may optionally be preceded by an explicit quantifier. The
    purpose of this quantifier is to specify how many of the things referred to by the
    sumti are being talked about. Here are some simple examples contrasting sumti with
    and without explicit quantifiers:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  do cadzu le bisli
    You walk-on the ice.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>   re do cadzu le bisli
    Two-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre>The difference between <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> and <a href="#e6d2">Example
6.2</a> is the presence of the explicit quantifier ``re'' in the latter example. Although
``re'' by itself means ``two'', when used as a quantifier it means ``two-of''. Out of the
group of listeners (the number of which isn't stated), two (we are not told which ones)
are asserted to be ``walkers on the ice''. Implicitly, the others (if any) are not
walkers on the ice. In Lojban, you cannot say ``I own three shoes'' if in fact you own
four shoes. Numbers need never be specified, but if they are specified they must be
correct.

    <p>(This rule does not mean that there is no way to specify a number which is vague.
    The sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi ponse su'o ci cutci
    I possess at-least three shoes.
</pre>is true if you own three shoes, or four, or indeed any larger number. More details
on vague numbers appear in the discussion of mathematical expressions in <a href=
"chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>.)

    <p>Now consider <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> again. How many of the listeners are
    claimed to walk on the ice? The answer turns out to be: all of them, however many
    that is. So <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> and <a href="#e6d4">Example 6.4</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  ro do cadzu le bisli
    All-of you walk-on the ice.
</pre>turn out to mean exactly the same thing. This is a safe strategy, because if one of
my listeners doesn't turn out to be walking on the ice, I can safely claim that I didn't
intend that person to be a listener! And in fact, all of the personal pro-sumti such as
``mi'' and ``mi'o'' and ``ko'' obey the same rule. We say that personal pro-sumti have a
so-called ``implicit quantifier'' of ``ro'' (all). This just means that if no quantifier
is given explicitly, the meaning is the same as if the implicit quantifier had been used.

    <p>Not all sumti have ``ro'' as the implicit quantifier, however. Consider the
    quotation in:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  mi cusku lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
    I say, ``You walk on the ice.''
</pre>

    <p>What is the implicit quantifier of the quotation ``lu do cadzu le bisli li'u''?
    Surely not ``ro''. If ``ro'' were supplied explicitly, thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  mi cusku ro lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express all-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>the meaning would be something like ``I say every occurrence of the sentence 'You
walk on the ice'''. Of course I don't say every occurrence of it, only some occurrences.
One might suppose that <a href="#e6d5">Example 6.5</a> means that I express exactly one
occurrence, but it is more Lojbanic to leave the number unspecified, as with other sumti.
We can say definitely, however, that I say it at least once.

    <p>The Lojban cmavo meaning ``at least'' is ``su'o'', and if no ordinary number
    follows, ``su'o'' means ``at least once''. (See <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> for
    the use of ``su'o'' with an ordinary number). Therefore, the explicitly quantified
    version of <a href="#e6d5">Example 6.5</a> is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  mi cusku su'o lu do cadzu
        le bisli li'u
    I express at-least-one-of [quote] you walk-on
        the ice [unquote].
    I say one or more instances of ``You walk on the ice''.
    I say ``You walk on the ice''.
</pre>

    <p>If an explicit ordinary number such as ``re'' were to appear, it would have to
    convey an exact expression, so</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  mi cusku re lu do cadzu le bisli li'u
    I express two-of [quote] you walk-on the ice [unquote].
</pre>means that I say the sentence exactly twice, neither more nor less.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s7" name="s7">7. Quantified descriptions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s7" name="s7">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s7" name="s7">Like other sumti, descriptions can be quantified. When a
quantifier appears before a description, it has the same meaning as one appearing before
a non-description sumti: it specifies how many things, of all those referred to by the
description, are being talked about in this particular bridi. Suppose that context tells
us that ``le gerku'' refers to three dogs. Then we can say that exactly two of them are
white as follows:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  re le gerku cu blabi
    two-of the dogs are-white.
    Two of the dogs are white.
</pre>When discussing descriptions, this ordinary quantifier is called an ``outer
quantifier'', since it appears outside the description. But there is another possible
location for a quantifier: between the descriptor and the selbri. This quantifier is
called an ``inner quantifier'', and its meaning is quite different: it tells the listener
how many objects the description selbri characterizes.

    <p>For example, the context of <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> supposedly told us
    that ``le gerku'' referred to some three specific dogs. This assumption can be made
    certain with the use of an explicit inner quantifier:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  re le ci gerku cu blabi
    two-of the three dogs are-white.
    Two of the three dogs are white.
</pre>(As explained in the discussion of <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a>, simple numbers
like those in <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a> must be exact: it therefore follows that
the third dog cannot be white.)

    <p>You may also specify an explicit inner quantifier and leave the outer quantifier
    implicit:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  le ci gerku cu blabi
    the three dogs are-white.
    The three dogs are white.
</pre>There are rules for each of the 11 descriptors specifying what the implicit values
for the inner and outer quantifiers are. They are meant to provide sensible default
values when context is absent, not necessarily to prescribe hard and fast rules. The
following table lists the implicit values:

    <dl>
      <dt>le:</dt>

      <dd>ro le su'o all of the at-least-one described as</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>lo:</dt>

      <dd>su'o lo ro at least one of all of those which really are</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>la:</dt>

      <dd>ro la su'o all of the at least one named</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>lei:</dt>

      <dd>pisu'o lei su'o some part of the mass of the at-least-one described as</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>loi:</dt>

      <dd>pisu'o loi ro some part of the mass of all those that really are</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>lai:</dt>

      <dd>pisu'o lai su'o some part of the mass of the at-least-one named</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>le'i:</dt>

      <dd>piro le'i su'o the whole of the set of the at-least-one described as</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>lo'i:</dt>

      <dd>piro lo'i ro the whole of the set of all those that really are</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>la'i:</dt>

      <dd>piro la'i su'o the whole of the set of the at-least-one named</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>le'e:</dt>

      <dd>ro le'e su'o all the stereotypes of the at-least-one described as</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>lo'e:</dt>

      <dd>su'o lo'e ro at least one of the types of all those that really are</dd>
    </dl>When examined for the first time, this table looks dreadfully arbitrary. In
    fact, there are quite a few regularities in it. First of all, the la-series (that is,
    the descriptors ``la'', ``lai'', and ``la'i'') and the le-series (that is, the
    descriptors ``le'', ``lei'', ``le'i'', and ``le'e'') always have corresponding
    implicit quantifiers, so we may subsume the la-series under the le-series for the
    rest of this discussion: ``le-series cmavo'' will refer to both the le-series proper
    and to the la-series.

    <p>The rule for the inner quantifier is very simple: the lo-series cmavo (namely,
    ``lo'', ``loi'', ``lo'i'', and ``lo'e'') all have an implicit inner quantifier of
    ``ro'', whereas the le-series cmavo all have an implicit inner quantifier of
    ``su'o''.</p>

    <p>Why? Because lo-series descriptors always refer to all of the things which really
    fit into the x1 place of the selbri. They are not restricted by the speaker's
    intention. Descriptors of the le-series, however, are so restricted, and therefore
    talk about some number, definite or indefinite, of objects the speaker has in mind
    --- but never less than one.</p>

    <p>Understanding the implicit outer quantifier requires rules of greater subtlety. In
    the case of mass and set descriptors, a single rule suffices for each: reference to a
    mass is implicitly a reference to some part of the mass; reference to a set is
    implicitly a reference to the whole set. Masses and sets are inherently singular
    objects: it makes no sense to talk about two distinct masses with the same
    components, or two distinct sets with the same members. Therefore, the largest
    possible outer quantifier for either a set description or a mass description is
    ``piro'', the whole of it.</p>

    <p>(Pedantically, it is possible that the mass of water molecules composing an ice
    cube might be thought of as different from the same mass of water molecules in liquid
    form, in which case we might talk about ``re lei djacu'', two masses of the
    water-bits I have in mind.)</p>

    <p>Why ``pi-''? It is the Lojban cmavo for the decimal point. Just as ``pimu'' means
    ``.5'', and when used as a quantifier specifies a portion consisting of five tenths
    of a thing, ``piro'' means a portion consisting of the all-ness -- the entirety ---
    of a thing. Similarly, ``pisu'o'' specifies a portion consisting of at least one part
    of a thing, i.e. some of it.</p>

    <p>Smaller quantifiers are possible for sets, and refer to subsets. Thus ``pimu le'i
    nanmu'' is a subset of the set of men I have in mind; we don't know precisely which
    elements make up this subset, but it must have half the size of the full set. This is
    the best way to say ``half of the men''; saying ``pimu le nanmu'' would give us a
    half-portion of one of them instead! Of course, the result of ``pimu le'i nanmu'' is
    still a set; if you need to refer to the individuals of the subset, you must say so
    (see ``lu'a'' in <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>).</p>

    <p>The case of outer quantifiers for individual descriptors (including ``le'',
    ``lo'', ``la'', and the typical descriptors ``le'e'' and ``lo'e'') is special. When
    we refer to specific individuals with ``le'', we mean to refer to all of those we
    have in mind, so ``ro'' is appropriate as the implicit quantifier, just as it is
    appropriate for ``do''. Reference to non-specific individuals with ``lo'', however,
    is typically to only some of the objects which can be correctly described, and so
    ``su'o'' is the appropriate implicit quantifier, just as for quotations.</p>

    <p>From the English-speaking point of view, the difference in structure between the
    following example using ``le'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  [ro] le ci gerku cu blabi
    [all-of] those-described-as three dogs are-white.
    The three dogs are white.
</pre>and the corresponding form with ``lo'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  ci lo [ro] gerku cu blabi
    three-of those-which-are [all] dogs are-white
    Three dogs are white.
</pre>looks very peculiar. Why is the number ``ci'' found as an inner quantifier in
<a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a> and as an outer quantifier in <a href="#e7d5">Example
7.5</a>? The number of dogs is the same in either case. The answer is that the ``ci'' in
<a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a> is part of the specification: it tells us the actual
number of dogs in the group that the speaker has in mind. In <a href="#e7d5">Example
7.5</a>, however, the dogs referred to by ``... lo gerku'' are all the dogs that exist:
the outer quantifier then restricts the number to three; which three, we cannot tell. The
implicit quantifiers are chosen to avoid claiming too much or too little: in the case of
``le'', the implicit outer quantifier ``ro'' says that each of the dogs in the restricted
group is white; in the case of ``lo'', the implicit inner quantifier simply says that
three dogs, chosen from the group of all the dogs there are, are white.

    <p>Using exact numbers as inner quantifiers in lo-series descriptions is dangerous,
    because you are stating that exactly that many things exist which really fit the
    description. So examples like</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  [su'o] lo ci gerku cu blabi
    [some-of] those-which-really-are three dogs are-white
</pre>are semantically anomalous; <a href="#e7d7">Example 7.7</a> claims that some dog
(or dogs) is white, but also that there are just three dogs in the universe!

    <p>Nevertheless, inner quantifiers are permitted on ``lo'' descriptors for
    consistency's sake, and may occasionally be useful.</p>

    <p>Note that the inner quantifier of ``le'', even when exact, need not be truthful:
    ``le ci nanmu'' means ``what I describe as three men'', not ``three of what I
    describe as men''. This follows from the rule that what is described by a ``le''
    description represents the speaker's viewpoint rather than the objective way things
    are.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s8" name="s8">8. Indefinite descriptions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s8" name="s8">By a quirk of Lojban syntax, it is possible to omit the
    descriptor ``lo'', but never any other descriptor, from a description like that
    of</a> <a href="#e7d5">Example 7.5</a>; namely, one which has an explicit outer
    quantifier but no explicit inner quantifier. The following example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  ci gerku [ku] cu blabi
    Three dogs are white.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e7d5">Example 7.5</a>. Even though the
descriptor is not present, the elidable terminator ``ku'' may still be used. The name
``indefinite description'' for this syntactic form is historically based: of course, it
is no more and no less indefinite than its counterpart with an explicit ``lo''.
Indefinite descriptions were introduced into the language in order to imitate the syntax
of English and other natural languages.

    <p>Indefinite descriptions must fit this mold exactly: there is no way to make one
    which does not have an explicit outer quantifier (thus ``*gerku cu blabi'' is
    ungrammatical), or which has an explicit inner quantifier (thus ``*reboi ci gerku cu
    blabi'' is also ungrammatical --- ``re ci gerku cu blabi'' is fine, but means ``23
    dogs are white'').</p>

    <p>Note: <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> also contains an indefinite description,
    namely ``su'o ci cutci''; another version of that example using an explicit ``lo''
    would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  mi ponse su'o ci lo cutci
    I possess at-least three things-which-really-are shoes
    I own three (or more) shoes.
</pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s9" name="s9">9. sumti-based descriptions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s9" name="s9">As stated in</a> <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>, most
    descriptions consist of just a descriptor and a selbri. (In this chapter, the selbri
    have always been single gismu, but of course any selbri, however complex, can be
    employed in a description. The syntax and semantics of selbri are explained in
    <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.) In the intervening sections, inner and outer
    quantifiers have been added to the syntax. Now it is time to discuss a description of
    a radically different kind: the sumti-based description.</p>

    <p>A sumti-based description has a sumti where the selbri would normally be, and the
    inner quantifier is required --- it cannot be implicit. An outer quantifier is
    permitted but not required.</p>

    <p>A full theory of sumti-based descriptions has yet to be worked out. One common
    case, however, is well understood. Compare the following:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  re do cu nanmu
    Two-of you are-men.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  le re do cu nanmu
    The two-of you are men.
</pre><a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> simply specifies that of the group of listeners,
size unknown, two are men. <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, which has the sumti-based
description ``le re do'', says that of the two listeners, all (the implicit outer
quantifier ``ro'') are men. So in effect the inner quantifier ``re'' gives the number of
individuals which the inner sumti ``do'' refers to.

    <p>Here is another group of examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  re le ci cribe cu bunre
    Two-of the three bears are-brown.

    The two-of the three bears are-brown.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>   pa le re le ci cribe cu bunre
    One-of the two-of the three bears are-brown.
</pre>In each case, ``le ci cribe'' restricts the bears (or alleged bears) being talked
of to some group of three which the speaker has in mind. <a href="#e9d3">Example 9.3</a>
says that two of them (which two is not stated) are brown. <a href="#e9d4">Example
9.4</a> says that a specific pair of them are brown. <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> says
that of a specific pair chosen from the original three, one or the other of that pair is

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s10" name="s10">Well, that's quite a list of cmavo. What are they all
    about?</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s10" name="s10">The above cmavo and compound cmavo are called the ``sumti
    qualifiers''. All of them are either single cmavo of selma'o LAhE, or else compound
    cmavo involving a scalar negation cmavo of selma'o NAhE immediately followed by
    ``bo'' of selma'o BO. Syntactically, you can prefix a sumti qualifier to any sumti
    and produce another simple sumti. (You may need to add the elidable terminator
    ``lu'u'' to show where the qualified sumti ends.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s10" name="s10">Semantically, sumti qualifiers represent short forms of
    certain common special cases. Suppose you want to say ``I see 'The Red Pony''', where
    ``The Red Pony'' is the title of a book. How about:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s10" name="s10"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s10" name="s10"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d1" name=
"e10d1">10.1)</a>    mi viska lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
    I see [quote] the red small-horse [unquote]
</pre>

    <p>But <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> doesn't work: it says that you see a piece
    of text ``The Red Pony''. That might be all right if you were looking at the cover of
    the book, where the words ``The Red Pony'' are presumably written. (More precisely,
    where the words ``le xunre cmaxirma'' are written -- but we may suppose the book has
    been translated into Lojban.)</p>

    <p>What you really want to say is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi viska le selsinxa be
        lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u
    I see the thing-represented-by
        [quote] the red small-horse [unquote]
</pre>

    <p>The x2 place of ``selsinxa'' (the x1 place of ``sinxa'') is a sign or symbol, and
    the x1 place of ``selsinxa'' (the x2 place of ``sinxa'') is the thing represented by
    the sign. <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a> allows us to use a symbol (namely the
    title of a book) to represent the thing it is a symbol of (namely the book
    itself).</p>

    <p>This operation turns out to be needed often enough that it's useful to be able to
    say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    mi viska la'e lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u [lu'u]
    I see the-referent-of
        [quote] the red small-horse [unquote].
</pre>So when ``la'e'' is prefixed to a sumti referring to a symbol, it produces a sumti
referring to the referent of that symbol. (In computer jargon, ``la'e'' dereferences a
pointer.)

    <p>By introducing a sumti qualifier, we correct a false sentence (<a href=
    "#e10d1">Example 10.1</a>), which too closely resembles its literal English
    equivalent, into a true sentence (<a href="#e10d3">Example 10.3</a>), without having
    to change it overmuch; in particular, the structure remains the same. Most of the
    uses of sumti qualifiers are of this general kind.</p>

    <p>The sumti qualifier ``lu'e'' provides the converse operation: it can be prefixed
    to a sumti referring to some thing to produce a sumti referring to a sign or symbol
    for the thing. For example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi pu cusku lu'e le vi cukta
    I [past] express a-symbol-for the nearby book.
    I said the title of this book.
</pre>

    <p>The equivalent form not using a sumti qualifier would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    mi pu cusku le sinxa be le vi cukta
    I [past] express the symbol-for the nearby book.
</pre>which is equivalent to <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a>, but longer.

    <p>The other sumti qualifiers follow the same rules. The cmavo ``tu'a'' is used in
    forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter
    11</a>. The triplet ``lu'a'', ``lu'i'', and ``lu'o'' convert between individuals,
    masses, and sets; ``vu'i'' belongs to this group as well, but creates a sequence,
    which is similar to a set but has a definite order. (The set of John and Charles is
    the same as the set of Charles and John, but the sequences are different.) Here are
    some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    mi troci tu'a le vorme
    I try some-abstraction-about the door.
    I try (to open) the door.
</pre><a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a> might mean that I try to do something else
involving the door; the form is deliberately vague.

    <p>Most of the following examples make use of the cmavo ``ri'', belonging to selma'o
    KOhA. This cmavo means ``the thing last mentioned''; it is equivalent to repeating
    the immediately previous sumti (but in its original context). It is explained in more
    detail in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    lo'i ratcu cu barda
        .iku'i lu'a ri cmalu

        But some-members-of it-last-mentioned is-small
    The set of rats is large,
        but some of its members are small.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a> lo ratcu cu cmalu
        .iku'i lu'i ri barda
    some rats are-small.
        But the-set-of them-last-mentioned is-large.
    Some rats are small, but the set of rats is large.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a> mi ce do girzu

        .i vu'i ri porsi

        The-mass-of it-last-mentioned is-a-mass.
        The-sequence-of it-last-mentioned is-a-sequence
    The set of you and me is a set.
        The mass of you and me is a mass.
        The sequence of you and me is a sequence.
</pre>(Yes, I know these examples are a bit silly. This set was introduced for
completeness, and practical examples are as yet hard to come by.)

    <p>Finally, the four sumti qualifiers formed from a cmavo of NAhE and ``bo'' are all
    concerned with negation, which is discussed in detail in <a href=
    "chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>. Here are a few examples of negation sumti
    qualifiers:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  mi viska na'ebo le gerka
    I see something-other-than the dog.
</pre>

    <p>This compound, ``na'ebo'', is the most common of the four negation sumti
    qualifiers. The others usually only make sense in the context of repeating, with
    modifications, something already referred to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>  mi nelci loi glare cidja
        .ije do nelci
            to'ebo ri
        .ije la djein. nelci
            no'ebo ra
    I like part-of-the-mass-of hot-type-of food.
        And you like
            the-opposite-of the-last-mentioned.
        And Jane likes
            the-neutral-value-of something-mentioned.
    I like hot food, and you like cold food,
        and Jane likes lukewarm food.
</pre>(In <a href="#e10d11">Example 10.11</a>, the sumti ``ra'' refers to some previously
mentioned sumti other than that referred to by ``ri''. We cannot use ``ri'' here, because
it would signify ``la djein.'', that being the most recent sumti available to ``ri''. See
more detailed explanations in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>.)

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s11" name="s11">11. The syntax of vocative phrases</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s11" name="s11">Vocative phrases are not sumti, but are explained in this
    chapter because their syntax is very similar to that of sumti. Grammatically, a
    vocative phrase is one of the so-called ``free modifiers'' of Lojban, along with
    subscripts, parentheses, and various other constructs explained in</a> <a href=
    "chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>. They can be placed after many, but not all,
    constructions of the grammar: in general, after any elidable terminator (which,
    however, must not then be elided!), at the beginnings and ends of sentences, and in
    many other places.</p>

    <p>The purpose of a vocative phrase is to indicate who the person being addressed is,
    or to indicate to that person that he or she ought to be listening. A vocative phrase
    begins with a cmavo of selma'o COI or DOI, all of which are explained in more detail
    in <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>. Sometimes that is all there is to the
    phrase:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    coi
    [greetings]
    Hello.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a> je'e
    [acknowledgement]
    Uh-huh.
    Roger!
</pre>In these cases, the person being addressed is obvious from the context. However, a
vocative word (more precisely, one or more cmavo of COI, possibly followed by ``doi'', or
else just ``doi'' by itself) can be followed by one of several kinds of phrases, all of
which are intended to indicate the addressee. The most common case is a name:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d2.5" name="e11d2.5">11.2.5)</a>    coi. djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>

    <p>A pause is required (for morphological reasons) between a member of COI and a
    name. You can use ``doi'' instead of a pause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    coi doi djan.
    Hello, John.
</pre>means exactly the same thing and does not require a pause. Using ``doi'' by itself
is like just saying someone's name to attract his or her attention:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    doi djan.
    John!
</pre>In place of a name, a description may appear, lacking its descriptor, which is
understood to be ``le'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    coi xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, (red-type-of dress)-type-of girl.
    Hello, girl with the red dress!
</pre>The listener need not really be a ``xunre pastu nixli'', as long as she understands
herself correctly from the description. (Actually, only a bare selbri can appear;
explicit quantifiers are forbidden in this form of vocative, so the implicit quantifiers
``su'o le ro'' are in effect.)

    <p>Finally, a complete sumti may be used, the most general case.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    co'o la bab. .e la noras.
    Goodbye, Bob and Nora.
</pre><a href="#e11d5">Example 11.5</a> is thus the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a>    coi le xunre pastu nixli
    Hello, the-one-described-as red-dress girl!
</pre>and <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> is the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d8" name="e11d8">11.8)</a>    doi la djan.
    The-one-named John!
</pre>Finally, the elidable terminator for vocative phrases is ``do'u'' (of selma'o
DOhU), which is rarely needed except when a simple vocative word is being placed
somewhere within a bridi. It may also be required when a vocative is placed between a
sumti and its relative clause, or when there are a sequence of so-called ``free
modifiers'' (vocatives, subscripts, utterance ordinals --- see <a href="chapter18.html">
    Chapter 18</a> --- metalinguistic comments --- see <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter
    19</a> --- or reciprocals --- see <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>) which must
    be properly separated.

    <p>The meaning of a vocative phrase that is within a sentence is not affected by its
    position in the sentence: thus <a href="#e11d9">Example 11.9</a> and <a href=
    "#e11d10">Example 11.10</a> mean the same thing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d9" name="e11d9">11.9)</a>    doi djan. ko klama mi
    John, come to me!

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e11d10" name="e11d10">11.10)</a>   ko klama mi doi djan.
    Come to me, John!
</pre>

    <p>As usual for this chapter, the full syntax of vocative phrases has not been
    explained: relative clauses, discussed in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>, make
    for more possibilities.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s12" name="s12">12. Lojban names</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s12" name="s12">Names have been used freely as sumti throughout this
    chapter without too much explanation. The time for the explanation has now
    come.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s12" name="s12">First of all, there are two different kinds of things
    usually called ``names'' when talking about Lojban. The naming predicates of</a>
    <a href="#s2">Section 2</a> are just ordinary predicates which are being used in a
    special sense. In addition, though, there is a class of Lojban words which are used
    only to name things: these can be recognized by the fact that they end in a consonant
    followed by a pause. Some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    djan. meris. djein. .alis.
    John.  Mary.  Jane.  Alice.
</pre>(Note that ``.alis.'' begins as well as ends with a pause, because all Lojban words
beginning with a vowel must be preceded by a pause. See <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter
4</a> for more information.)

    <p>Names of this kind have two basic uses in Lojban: when used in a vocative phrase
    (see <a href="#s11">Section 11</a>) they indicate who the listener is or should be.
    When used with a descriptor of selma'o LA, namely ``la'', ``lai'', or ``la'i'', they
    form sumti which refer to the persons or things known by the name.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la djonz. klama le zarci
    Jones goes to-the store.
    The Joneses go to-the store.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    lai djonz. klama le zarci
    The-mass-of Joneses go to-the store.
    The Joneses go to the store.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a>, the significance is that all the persons
    (perhaps only one) I mean to refer to by the name ``djonz.'' are going to the store.
    In <a href="#e12d3">Example 12.3</a>, the Joneses are massified, and only some part
    of them needs to be going. Of course, by ``djonz.'' I can mean whomever I want: that
    person need not use the name ``djonz.'' at all.</p>

    <p>The sumti in <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> and <a href="#e12d3">Example
    12.3</a> operate exactly like the similar uses of ``la'' and ``lai'' in <a href=
    "#e2d5">Examples 2.5</a> and <a href="#e3d6">3.6</a> respectively. The only
    difference is that these descriptors are followed by Lojban name-words. And in fact,
    the only difference between descriptors of selma'o LA (these three) and of selma'o LE
    (all the other descriptors) is that the former can be followed by name-words, whereas
    the latter cannot.</p>

    <p>There are certain limitations on the form of name-words in Lojban. In particular,
    they cannot contain the letter-sequences (or sound-sequences) ``la'', ``lai'', or
    ``doi'' unless a consonant immediately precedes within the name. Reciprocally, every
    name not preceded by ``la'', ``lai'', ``la'i'', or ``doi'' must be preceded by a
    pause instead:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    coi .djan.
    Hello, John.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a> zo .djan. cmene mi
    The-word ``John'' is-the-name-of me.
    My name is John.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a> and <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>,
    ``.djan.'' appears with a pause before it as well as after it, because the preceding
    word is not one of the four special cases. These rules force names to always be
    separable from the general word-stream.</p>

    <p>Unless some other rule prevents it (such as the rule that ``zo'' is always
    followed by a single word, which is quoted), multiple names may appear wherever one
    name is permitted, each with its terminating pause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    doi djan. pol. djonz.
        le bloti cu klama fi la niuport. niuz.
    John Paul Jones,
        the boat comes (to somewhere) from Newport News.
</pre>A name may not contain any consonant combination that is illegal in Lojban words
generally: the ``impermissible consonant clusters'' of Lojban morphology (explained in
<a href="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</a>). Thus ``djeimz.'' is not a valid version of
``James'' (because ``mz'' is invalid): ``djeimyz'' will suffice. Similarly, ``la'' may be
replaced by ``ly'', ``lai'' by ``ly'i'', ``doi'' by ``do'i'' or ``dai''. Here are a few
examples:
    <pre>
   English name        invalid Lojban name valid Lojban names
</pre>
    <pre>
   Doyle           *doi,l          do'il or dai,l
    Lyra            *lairas         ly'iras
    Lottie (American pron.) *latis          LYtis. or lotis.
</pre>Names may be borrowed from other languages or created arbitrarily. Another common
practice is to use one or more rafsi, arranged to end with a consonant, to form a name:
thus the rafsi ``loj-'' for ``logji'' (logical) and ``ban-'' for ``bangu'' (language)
unite to form the name of this language:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    lojban.
    Lojban
</pre>When borrowing names from another language which end in a vowel, or when turning a
Lojban brivla (all of which end in vowels) into a name, the vowel may be removed or an
arbitrary consonant added. It is common (but not required) to use the consonants ``s'' or
``n'' when borrowing vowel-final names from English; speakers of other languages may wish
to use other consonant endings.

    <p>The implicit quantifier for name sumti of the form ``la'' followed by a name is
    ``su'o'', just as for ``la'' followed by a selbri.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s13" name="s13">13. Pro-sumti summary</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s13" name="s13">The Lojban pro-sumti are the cmavo of selma'o KOhA. They
    fall into several classes: personal, definable, quantificational, reflexive,
    back-counting, indefinite, demonstrative, metalinguistic, relative, question. More
    details are given in</a> <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>; this section mostly
    duplicates information found there, but adds material on the implicit quantifier of
    each pro-sumti.</p>

    <p>The following examples illustrate each of the classes. Unless otherwise noted
    below, the implicit quantification for pro-sumti is ``ro'' (all). In the case of
    pro-sumti which refer to other sumti, the ``ro'' signifies ``all of those referred to
    by the other sumti'': thus it is possible to restrict, but not to extend, the
    quantification of the other sumti.</p>

    <p>Personal pro-sumti (``mi'', ``do'', ``mi'o'', ``mi'a'', ``ma'a'', ``do'o'',
    ``ko'') refer to the speaker or the listener or both, with or without third
    parties:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi prami do
    I love you.
</pre>The personal pro-sumti may be interpreted in context as either representing
individuals or masses, so the implicit quantifier may be ``pisu'o'' rather than ``ro'':
in particular, ``mi'o'', ``mi'a'', ``ma'a'', and ``do'o'' specifically represent mass
combinations of the individuals (you and I, I and others, you and I and others, you and
others) that make them up.

    <p>Definable pro-sumti (``ko'a'', ``ko'e'', ``ko'i'', ``ko'o'', ``ko'u'', ``fo'a'',
    ``fo'e'', ``fo'i'', ``fo'o'', ``fo'u'') refer to whatever the speaker has explicitly
    made them refer to. This reference is accomplished with ``goi'' (of selma'o GOI),
    which means ``defined-as''.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    le cribe goi ko'a cu xekri
        .i ko'a citka le smacu
    The bear defined-as it-1 is-black.
        It-1 eats the mouse.
</pre>Quantificational pro-sumti (``da'', ``de'', ``di'') are used as variables in bridi
involving predicate logic:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d3" name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    ro da poi prenu
        cu prami pa de poi finpe
    All somethings-1 which-are persons
        love one something-2 which-is a-fish.
    All persons love a fish (each his/her own).
</pre>(This is not the same as ``All persons love a certain fish''; the difference
between the two is one of quantifier order.) The implicit quantification rules for
quantificational pro-sumti are particular to them, and are discussed in detail in
    <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>. Roughly speaking, the quantifier is ``su'o''
    (at least one) when the pro-sumti is first used, and ``ro'' (all) thereafter.

    <p>Reflexive pro-sumti (``vo'a'', ``vo'e'', ``vo'i'', ``vo'o'', ``vo'u'') refer to
    the same referents as sumti filling other places in the same bridi, with the effect
    that the same thing is referred to twice:</p>

    The bear bites what-is-in-the-x1-place.
    The bear bites itself.
</pre>Back-counting pro-sumti (``ri'', ``ra'', ``ru'') refer to the referents of previous
sumti counted backwards from the pro-sumti:

    I go from Frankfurt to Frankfurt (by some unstated route).
</pre>Indefinite pro-sumti (``zo'e'', ``zu'i'', ``zi'o'') refer to something which is
unspecified:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    mi klama la frankfurt. zo'e zo'e zo'e
    I go to-Frankfurt from-unspecified via-unspecified
        by-means-unspecified.
</pre>The implicit quantifier for indefinite pro-sumti is, well, indefinite. It might be
``ro'' (all) or ``su'o'' (at least one) or conceivably even ``no'' (none), though ``no''
would require a very odd context indeed.

    <p>Demonstrative pro-sumti (``ti'', ``ta'', ``tu'') refer to things pointed at by the
    speaker, or when pointing is not possible, to things near or far from the
    speaker:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d7" name="e13d7">13.7)</a>    ko muvgau ti ta tu
    you [imperative] move this-thing from-that-nearby-place
        to-that-further-away-place
    Move this from there to over there!
</pre>Metalinguistic pro-sumti (``di'u'', ``de'u'', ``da'u'', ``di'e'', ``de'e'',
``da'e'', ``dei'', ``do'i'') refer to spoken or written utterances, either preceding,
following, or the same as the current utterance.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a>    li re su'i re du li vo
        .i la'e di'u jetnu
    The-number two plus two equals the-number four.
        The-referent-of the-previous-utterance is-true.
</pre>The implicit quantifier for metalinguistic pro-sumti is ``su'o'' (at least one),
because they are considered analogous to ``lo'' descriptions: they refer to things which
really are previous, current, or following utterances.

    <p>The relative pro-sumti (``ke'a'') is used within relative clauses (see <a href=
    "chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a> for a discussion of relative clauses) to refer to
    whatever sumti the relative clause is attached to.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d9" name="e13d9">13.9)</a>    mi viska le mlatu ku

    I see the cat(s)
        such-that something-unspecified makes it/them (the cats)
        from-a-mass-of plastic.
    I see the cat(s) made of plastic.
</pre>The question pro-sumti (``ma'') is used to ask questions which request the listener
to supply a sumti which will make the question into a truth:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e13d10" name="e13d10">13.10)</a>  do klama ma
    You go to-what-sumti?
    Where are you going?
</pre>The implicit quantifier for the question pro-sumti is ``su'o'' (at least one),
because the listener is only being asked to supply a single answer, not all correct
answers.

    <p>In addition, sequences of lerfu words (of selma'o BY and related selma'o) can also
    be used as definable pro-sumti.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s14" name="s14">14. Quotation summary</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s14" name="s14">There are four kinds of quotation in Lojban: text
    quotation, words quotation, single-word quotation, non-Lojban quotation. More
    information is provided in</a> <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>.</p>

    <p>Text quotations are preceded by ``lu'' and followed by ``li'u'', and are an
    essential part of the surrounding text: they must be grammatical Lojban texts.</p>

    I say the-text [quote] I-am John [unquote].
    I say ``I'm John''.
</pre>Words quotations are quotations of one or more Lojban words. The words need not
mean anything, but they must be morphologically valid so that the end of the quotation
can be discerned.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    mi cusku lo'u li mi le'u
    I say the-words [quote] ``li mi'' [unquote].
    I say ``li mi''.
</pre>

    <p>Note that the translation of <a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a> does not translate
    the Lojban words, because they are not presumed to have any meaning (in fact, they
    are ungrammatical).</p>

    <p>Single-word quotation quotes a single Lojban word. Compound cmavo are not
    allowed.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e14d3" name="e14d3">14.3)</a>    mi cusku zo .ai
    I say the-word ``.ai''.
</pre>Non-Lojban quotation can quote anything, Lojban or not, even non-speech such as
drum talk, whistle words, music, or belching. A Lojban word which does not appear within
the quotation is used before and after it to set it off from the surrounding Lojban text.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e14d4" name="e14d4">14.4)</a>    mi cusku zoi kuot. I'm John .kuot
    I say ``I'm John''.
</pre>The implicit quantifier for all types of quotation is ``su'o'' (at least one),
because quotations are analogous to ``lo'' descriptions: they refer to things which
actually are words or sequences of words.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s15" name="s15">15. Number summary</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-s15" name="s15">The sumti which refer to numbers consist of the cmavo
    ``li'' (of selma'o LI) followed by an arbitrary Lojban mekso, or mathematical
    expression. This can be anything from a simple number up to the most complicated
    combination of numbers, variables, operators, and so on. Much more information on
    numbers is given in</a> <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>. Here are a few
    examples of increasing complexity:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e15d1" name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    li vo

    4

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a> li re su'i re

    2 + 2

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a> li .abu bopi'i xy. bote'a re
        su'i by. bopi'i xy. su'i cy.
    the-number a times x to-power 2
        plus b times x plus c
    ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c
</pre>An alternative to ``li'' is ``me'o'', also of selma'o LI. Number expressions
beginning with ``me'o'' refer to the actual expression, rather than its value. Thus
<a href="#e15d1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="#e15d2">Example 15.2</a> above have the
same meaning, the number four, whereas
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-6-e15d4" name="e15d4">15.4)</a>    me'o vo
    the-expression four

    the-expression two plus two
    ``2+2''
</pre>refer to different pieces of text.

    <p>The implicit quantifier for numbers and mathematical expressions is ``su'o'',
    because these sumti are analogous to ``lo'' descriptions: they refer to things which
    actually are numbers or pieces of text. In the case of numbers (with ``li''), this is
    a distinction without a difference, as there is only one number which is 4; but there
    are many texts ``4'', as many as there are documents in which that numeral
    appears.</p>

      Brevity Is The Soul Of Language: Pro-sumti And Pro-bridi</h1><!--

    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s1" name="s1">1. What are pro-sumti and pro-bridi? What are they
    for?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s1" name="s1">Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages, require
    mechanisms of abbreviation. If every time we referred to something, we had to express
    a complete description of it, life would be too short to say what we have to say. In
    English, we have words called ``pronouns'' which allow us to replace nouns or noun
    phrases with shorter terms. An English with no pronouns might look something like
    this:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e1d1" name=
"e1d1">1.1)</a>  Speakers of Lojban, like speakers of other languages,
    require mechanisms of abbreviation.  If every time
    speakers of Lojban referred to a thing to which
    speakers of Lojban refer, speakers of Lojban had to
    express a complete description of what speakers
    of Lojban referred to, life would be too short to say
    what speakers of Lojban have to say.
</pre>Speakers of this kind of English would get mightily sick of talking. Furthermore,
there are uses of pronouns in English which are independent of abbreviation. There is all
the difference in the world between:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  John picked up a stick and shook it.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  John picked up a stick and shook a stick.
</pre><a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a> does not imply that the two sticks are necessarily
the same, whereas <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> requires that they are.

    <p>In Lojban, we have sumti rather than nouns, so our equivalent of pronouns are
    called by the hybrid term ``pro-sumti''. A purely Lojban term would be ``sumti
    cmavo'': all of the pro-sumti are cmavo belonging to selma'o KOhA. In exactly the
    same way, Lojban has a group of cmavo (belonging to selma'o GOhA) which serve as
    selbri or full bridi. These may be called ``pro-bridi'' or ``bridi cmavo''. This
    chapter explains the uses of all the members of selma'o KOhA and GOhA. They fall into
    a number of groups, known as series: thus, in selma'o KOhA, we have among others the
    mi-series, the ko'a-series, the da-series, and so on. In each section, a series of
    pro-sumti is explained, and if there is a corresponding series of pro-bridi, it is
    explained and contrasted. Many pro-sumti series don't have pro-bridi analogues,
    however.</p>

    <p>A few technical terms: The term ``referent'' means the thing to which a pro-sumti
    (by extension, a pro-bridi) refers. If the speaker of a sentence is James, then the
    referent of the word ``I'' is James. On the other hand, the term ``antecedent''
    refers to a piece of language which a pro-sumti (or pro-bridi) implicitly repeats.
    In</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  John loves himself
</pre>the antecedent of ``himself'' is ``John''; not the person, but a piece of text (a
name, in this case). John, the person, would be the referent of ``himself''. Not all
pro-sumti or pro-bridi have antecedents, but all of them have referents.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s2" name="s2">2. Personal pro-sumti: the mi-series</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s2" name="s2">   mi  KOhA    mi-series   I, me
    do  KOhA    mi-series   you
    mi'o    KOhA    mi-series   you and I
    mi'a    KOhA    mi-series   I and others,
                    we but not you
    ma'a    KOhA    mi-series   you and I and others
    do'o    KOhA    mi-series   you and others
    ko  KOhA    mi-series   you-imperative
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s2" name="s2">The mi-series of pro-sumti refer to the speaker, the listener,
and others in various combinations. ``mi'' refers to the speaker and perhaps others for
whom the speaker speaks; it may be a Lojbanic mass. ``do'' refers to the listener or
listeners. Neither ``mi'' nor ``do'' is specific about the number of persons referred to;
for example, the foreman of a jury may refer to the members of the jury as ``mi'', since
in speaking officially he represents all of them.</a>

    <p>The referents of ``mi'' and ``do'' are usually obvious from the context, but may
    be assigned by the vocative words of selma'o COI, explained in <a href=
    "chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>. The vocative ``mi'e'' assigns ``mi'', whereas all of
    the other vocatives assign ``do''.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  mi'e djan. doi frank.
        mi cusku lu mi bajra li'u do
    I-am John, O Frank,
        I express [quote] I run [unquote] to-you
    I am John, Frank; I tell you ``I run''.
</pre>The cmavo ``mi'o'', ``mi'a'', ``ma'a'', and ``do'o'' express various combinations
of the speaker and/or the listener and/or other people:

    <dl>
      <dd>``mi'o'' includes only the speaker and the listener but no one else; ``mi'a''
      includes the speaker and others but excludes the listener;</dd>

      <dd>``do'o'' includes the listener and others but excludes the speaker;</dd>

      <dd>``ma'a'' includes all three: speaker, listener, others.</dd>
    </dl>All of these pro-sumti represent masses. For example, ``mi'o'' is the same as
    ``mi joi do'', the mass of me and you considered jointly.

    <p>In English, ``we'' can mean ``mi'' or ``mi'o'' or ``mi'a'' or even ``ma'a'', and
    English-speakers often suffer because they mistake ``mi'o'' for ``mi'a'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  We're going to the store.
</pre>

    <p>Does this include the listener or not? There's no way to be sure.</p>

    <p>Finally, the cmavo ``ko'' is logically equivalent to ``do''; its referent is the
    listener. However, its use alters an assertion about the listener into a command to
    the listener to make the assertion true:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  do klama le zarci
    You go to-the store.
</pre>becomes:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  ko klama le zarci
    You [imperative] go to-the store.
    Make ``you go to the store'' true!
    Go to the store!
</pre>In English, the subject of a command is omitted, but in Lojban, the word ``ko''
must be used. However, ``ko'' does not have to appear in the x1 place:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  mi viska ko
    I see you [imperative]
    Make ``I see you'' true!
    Be seen by me!
</pre>In <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a>, it is necessary to make the verb passive in
English in order to convey the effect of ``ko'' in the x2 place. Indeed, ``ko'' does not
even have to be a sumti of the main bridi:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  mi viska le prenu poi prami ko
    I see the person that loves you [imperative]
    Make ``I see the person that loves you'' true!
    Be such that the person who loves you is seen by me!
    Show me the person who loves you!
</pre>As mentioned in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, some pro-sumti series have
corresponding pro-bridi series. However, there is no equivalent of the mi-series among
pro-bridi, since a person isn't a relationship.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s3" name="s3">3. Demonstrative pro-sumti: the ti-series</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s3" name="s3">   ti  KOhA    ti-series   this here,
                    a nearby object
    ta  KOhA    ti-series   that there,
                    a medium-distant object
    tu  KOhA    ti-series   that yonder,
                    a far-distant object
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s3" name="s3">It is often useful to refer to things by pointing to them or
by some related non-linguistic mechanism. In English, the words ``this'' and ``that''
serve this function among others: ``this'' refers to something pointed at that is near
the speaker, and ``that'' refers to something further away. The Lojban pro-sumti of the
ti-series serve the same functions, but more narrowly. The cmavo ``ti'', ``ta'', and
``tu'' provide only the pointing function of ``this'' and ``that''; they are not used to
refer to things that cannot be pointed at.</a>

    <p>There are three pro-sumti of the ti-series rather than just two because it is
    often useful to distinguish between objects that are at more than two different
    distances. Japanese, among other languages, regularly does this. Until the 16th
    century, English did too; the pronoun ``that'' referred to something at a medium
    distance from the speaker, and the now-archaic pronoun ``yon'' to something far
    away.</p>

    <p>In conversation, there is a special rule about ``ta'' and ``tu'' that is often
    helpful in interpreting them. When used contrastingly, ``ta'' refers to something
    that is near the listener, whereas ``tu'' refers to something far from both speaker
    and listener. This makes for a parallelism between ``ti'' and ``mi'', and ``ta'' and
    ``do'', that is convenient when pointing is not possible; for example, when talking
    by telephone. In written text, on the other hand, the meaning of the ti-series is
    inherently vague; is the writer to be taken as pointing to something, and if so, to
    what? In all cases, what counts as ``near'' and ``far away'' is relative to the
    current situation.</p>

    <p>It is important to distinguish between the English pronoun ``this'' and the
    English adjective ``this'' as in ``this boat''. The latter is not represented in
    Lojban by ``ti'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  le ti bloti
    the this boat
</pre>does not mean ``this boat'' but rather ``this one's boat'', ``the boat associated
with this thing'', as explained in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>. A correct
Lojban translation of <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  le vi bloti
    the here boat
    the nearby boat
</pre>using a spatial tense before the selbri ``bloti'' to express that the boat is near
the speaker. (Tenses are explained in full in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>.)
Another correct translation would be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  ti noi bloti
    this-thing which-incidentally is-a-boat
</pre>There are no demonstrative pro-bridi to correspond to the ti-series: you can't
point to a relationship.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s4" name="s4">4. Utterance pro-sumti: the di'u-series</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s4" name="s4">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s4" name="s4">   di'u    KOhA    di'u-series the previous utterance
    de'u    KOhA    di'u-series an earlier utterance

    di'e    KOhA    di'u-series the next utterance
    de'e    KOhA    di'u-series a later utterance
    da'e    KOhA    di'u-series a much later utterance
    dei KOhA    di'u-series this very utterance
    do'i    KOhA    di'u-series some utterance
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s4" name="s4">The cmavo of the di'u-series enable us to talk about things
that have been, are being, or will be said. In English, it is normal to use ``this'' and
``that'' for this (indeed, the immediately preceding ``this'' is an example of such a
usage):</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  You don't like cats.
    That is untrue.
</pre>

    <p>Here ``that'' does not refer to something that can be pointed to, but to the
    preceding sentence ``You don't like cats''. In Lojban, therefore, <a href=
    "#e4d1">Example 4.1</a> is rendered:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  do na nelci loi mlatu
        .i di'u jitfa jufra
    You not like the-mass-of cats.
        The-previous-utterance is-a-false sentence..
</pre>Using ``ta'' instead of ``di'u'' would cause the listener to look around to see
what the speaker of the second sentence was physically pointing to.

    <p>As with ``ti'', ``ta'', and ``tu'', the cmavo of the di'u-series come in threes: a
    close utterance, a medium-distance utterance, and a distant utterance, either in the
    past or in the future. It turned out to be impossible to use the ``i''/``a''/``u''
    vowel convention discussed in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a> without causing collisions
    with other cmavo, and so the di'u-series has a unique ``i''/``e''/``a'' convention in
    the first vowel of the cmavo.</p>

    <p>Most references in speech are to the past (what has already been said), so
    ``di'e'', ``de'e'', and ``da'e'' are not very useful when speaking. In writing, they
    are frequently handy:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  la saimn. cusku di'e
    Simon expresses the-following-utterance.
    Simon says:
</pre><a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> would typically be followed by a quotation. Note
that although presumably the quotation is of something Simon has said in the past, the
quotation utterance itself would appear after <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a>, and so
``di'e'' is appropriate.

    <p>The remaining two cmavo, ``dei'' and ``do'i'', refer respectively to the very
    utterance that the speaker is uttering, and to some vague or unspecified utterance
    uttered by someone at some time:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  dei jetnu jufra
    This-utterance is-a-true sentence.
    What I am saying (at this moment) is true.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>   do'i jetnu jufra
    Some-utterance is-a-true sentence.
    That's true (where ``that'' is not necessarily what
        was just said).
</pre>The cmavo of the di'u-series have a meaning that is relative to the context. The
referent of ``dei'' in the current utterance is the same as the referent of ``di'u'' in
the next utterance. The term ``utterance'' is used rather than ``sentence'' because the
amount of speech or written text referred to by any of these words is vague. Often, a
single bridi is intended, but longer utterances may be thus referred to.

    <p>Note one very common construction with ``di'u'' and the cmavo ``la'e'' (of selma'o
    LAhE; see <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>) which precedes a sumti and means
    ``the thing referred to by (the sumti)'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  mi prami la djein.
        .i mi nelci la'e di'u
    I love Jane.
        And I like the-referent-of the-last-utterance.
    I love Jane, and I like that.
</pre>The effect of ``la'e di'u'' in <a href="#e4d6">Example 4.6</a> is that the speaker
likes, not the previous sentence, but rather the state of affairs referred to by the
previous sentence, namely his loving Jane. This cmavo compound is often written as a
single word: ``la'edi'u''. It is important not to mix up ``di'u'' and ``la'edi'u'', or
the wrong meaning will generally result:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  mi prami la djein.
        .i mi nelci di'u
    I love Jane.
        And I like the-last-utterance.
</pre>says that the speaker likes one of his own sentences.

    <p>There are no pro-bridi corresponding to the di'u-series.</p>

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s5" name="s5">The discussion of personal pro-sumti in</a> <a href=
"#s2">Section 2</a> may have seemed incomplete. In English, the personal pronouns include
not only ``I'' and ``you'' but also ``he'', ``she'', ``it'', and ``they''. Lojban does
have equivalents of this latter group: in fact, it has more of them than English does.
However, they are organized and used very differently.

    <p>There are ten cmavo in the ko'a-series, and they may be assigned freely to any
    sumti whatsoever. The English word ``he'' can refer only to males, ``she'' only to
    females (and ships and a few other things), ``it'' only to inanimate things, and
    ``they'' only to plurals; the cmavo of the ko'a-series have no restrictions at all.
    Therefore, it is almost impossible to guess from the context what ko'a-series cmavo
    might refer to if they are just used freely:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  la .alis. klama le zarci .i ko'a blanu
    Alice goes-to the store.  It-1 is-blue.
</pre>

    <p>The English gloss ``it-1'', plus knowledge about the real world, would tend to
    make English-speakers believe that ``ko'a'' refers to the store; in other words, that
    its antecedent is ``le zarci''. To a Lojbanist, however, ``la .alis.'' is just as
    likely an antecedent, in which case <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> means that Alice,
    not the store, is blue.</p>

    <p>To avoid this pitfall, Lojban employs special syntax, using the cmavo ``goi'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  la .alis. klama le zarci
        .i ko'a goi la .alis. cu blanu
    Alice goes-to the store.
        It-1, also-known-as Alice, is-blue.
</pre>Syntactically, ``goi la .alis.'' is a relative phrase (relative phrases are
explained in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>). Semantically, it says that ``ko'a''
and ``la .alis.'' refer to the same thing, and furthermore that this is true because
``ko'a'' is being defined as meaning ``la .alis.''. It is equally correct to say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  la .alis. klama le zarci
        .i la .alis. goi ko'a cu blanu
    Alice goes-to the store.
        Alice, also-known-as it-1, is-blue.
</pre>in other words, ``goi'' is symmetrical. There is a terminator, ``ge'u'' (of selma'o
GEhU), which is almost always elidable. The details are in <a href=
"chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>.

    <p>The afterthought form of ``goi'' shown in <a href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> and
    <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> is probably most common in speech, where we do not
    know until part way through our utterance that we will want to refer to Alice again.
    In writing, though, ``ko'a'' may be assigned at the point where Alice is first
    mentioned. An example of this forethought form of ``goi'' is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  la .alis. goi ko'a klama le zarci
        .i ko'a cu blanu
    Alice, also-known-as it-1, goes-to the store.
        It-1 is-blue.
</pre>Again, ``ko'a goi la .alis.'' would have been entirely acceptable in <a href=
"#e5d4">Example 5.4</a>. This last form is reminiscent of legal jargon: ``The party of
the first part, hereafter known as Buyer, ... ''.

    <p>Just as the ko'a-series of pro-sumti allows a substitute for a sumti which is long
    or complex, or which for some other reason we do not want to repeat, so the
    broda-series of pro-bridi allows a substitute for a selbri or even a whole bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ti slasi je mlatu bo cidja lante gacri cei broda
        .i le crino broda cu barda
        .i le xunre broda cu cmalu
    These are plastic cat-food can covers, or thingies.
        The green thingy is large.
        The red thingy is small.
</pre>The pro-bridi ``broda'' has as its antecedent the selbri ``slasi je mlatu bo cidja
lante gacri''. The cmavo ``cei'' performs the role of ``goi'' in assigning ``broda'' to
this long phrase, and ``broda'' can then be used just like any other brivla. (In fact,
``broda'' and its relatives actually <i>are</i> brivla: they are gismu in morphology,
although they behave exactly like the members of selma'o GOhA. The reasons for using
gismu rather than cmavo are buried in the Loglan Project's history.)

    <p>Note that pro-bridi are so called because, even though they have the grammar of
    selbri, their antecedents are whole bridi. In the following rather contrived example,
    the antecedent of ``brode'' is the whole bridi ``mi klama le zarci'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  mi klama cei brode le zarci .i do brode
    I go-to (which-is claim-1) the store.  You claim-1
    I go to the store.  You, too.
</pre>In the second bridi, ``do brode'' means ``do klama le zarci'', because ``brode''
carries the x2 sumti of ``mi klama le zarci'' along with it. It also potentially carries
the x1 sumti as well, but the explicit x1 sumti ``do'' overrides the ``mi'' of the
antecedent bridi. (Similarly, any tense or negation that is present in the antecedent is
also carried, and can be overridden by explicit tense or negation cmavo on the
pro-bridi.) These rules hold for all pro-bridi that have antecedents.

    <p>Another use of ``broda'' and its relatives, without assignment, is as ``sample
    gismu'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  broda ke brode brodi
    a thing-1 type of ( thing-2 type-of thing-3 )
</pre>represents an abstract pattern, a certain kind of tanru. (Historically, this use
was the original one.)

    <p>As is explained in <a href="chapter17.html">Chapter 17</a>, the words for Lojban
    letters, belonging to selma'o BY and certain related selma'o, are also usable as
    assignable pro-sumti. The main difference between letter pro-sumti and ko'a-series
    pro-sumti is that, in the absence of an explicit assignment, letters are taken to
    refer to the most recent name or description sumti beginning with the same
    letter:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  mi viska le gerku .i gy. cusku zo arf.
    I see the dog.  D expresses the-word ``Arf!''.
</pre>The Lojban word ``gerku'' begins with ``g'', so the antecedent of ``gy.'', the
cmavo for the letter ``g'', must be ``le gerku''. In the English translation, we use the
same principle to refer to the dog as ``D''. Of course, in case of ambiguity, ``goi'' can
be used to make an explicit assignment.

    <p>Furthermore, ``goi'' can even be used to assign a name:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  le ninmu goi la sam. cu klama le zarci
    The woman also-known-as Sam goes to-the store.
    The woman, whom I'll call Sam, goes to the store.
</pre>

    <p>This usage does not imply that the woman's name is Sam, or even that the speaker
    usually calls the woman ``Sam''. ``Sam'' is simply a name chosen, as if at random,
    for use in the current context only.</p>

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s6" name="s6">The term ``anaphora'' literally means ``repetition'', but is
used in linguistics to refer to pronouns whose significance is the repetition of earlier
words, namely their antecedents. Lojban provides three pro-sumti anaphora, ``ri'',
``ra'', and ``ru''; and three corresponding pro-bridi anaphora, ``go'i'', ``go'a'', and
``go'u''. These cmavo reveal the same vowel pattern as the ti-series, but the
``distances'' referred to are not physical distances, but distances from the anaphoric
cmavo to its antecedent.</a>

    <p>The cmavo ``ri'' is the simplest of these; it has the same referent as the last
    complete sumti appearing before the ``ri'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  la .alis. sipna le ri kumfa
    Alice sleeps-in the of-[repeat last sumti] room.
    Alice sleeps in her room.
</pre>The ``ri'' in <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> is equivalent to repeating the last
sumti, which is ``la .alis.'', so <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> is equivalent to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la .alis. sipna le la .alis. kumfa
    Alice sleeps-in the of-Alice room.
    Alice sleeps in Alice's room.
</pre>Note that ``ri'' does not repeat ``le ri kumfa'', because that sumti is not yet
complete when ``ri'' appears. This prevents ``ri'' from getting entangled in paradoxes of
self-reference. (There are plenty of other ways to do that!) Note also that sumti within
other sumti, as in quotations, abstractions, and the like, are counted in the order of
their beginnings; thus a lower level sumti like ``la alis.'' in <a href="#e6d2">Example
6.2</a> is considered to be more recent than a higher level sumti that contains it.

    <p>Certain sumti are ignored by ``ri''; specifically, most of the other cmavo of
    KOhA, and the almost-grammatically-equivalent lerfu words of selma'o BY. It is
    simpler just to repeat these directly:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi prami mi
    I love me.
    I love myself.
</pre>However, the cmavo of the ti-series can be picked up by ``ri'', because you might
have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating ``ti'' may not be effective.
Likewise, ``ri'' itself (or rather its antecedent) can be repeated by a later ``ri''; in
fact, a string of ``ri'' cmavo with no other intervening sumti always all repeat the same
sumti:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  la djan. viska le tricu
        .i ri se jadni
            le ri jimca
    John sees the tree.
        [repeat last] is-adorned-by
            the of-[repeat last] branch
    John sees the tree.  It is adorned by its branches.
</pre>

    <p>Here the second ``ri'' has as antecedent the first ``ri'', which has as antecedent
    ``le tricu''. All three refer to the same thing: a tree.</p>

    <p>To refer to the next-to-last sumti, the third-from-last sumti, and so on, ``ri''
    may be subscripted (subscripts are explained in <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter
    19</a>):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  lo smuci .i lo forca .i la rik. pilno rixire
        .i la .alis. pilno riximu
    A spoon.  A fork.  Rick uses [repeat next-to-last].
        Alice uses [repeat fifth-from-last].
</pre>

    <p>Here ``rixire'', or ``ri-sub-2'', skips ``la rik.'' to reach ``lo forca''. In the
    same way, ``riximu'', or ``ri-sub-5'', skips ``la .alis.'', ``rixire'', ``la rik.'',
    and ``lo forca'' to reach ``lo smuci''. As can clearly be seen, this procedure is
    barely practicable in writing, and would break down totally in speech.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the vaguer ``ra'' and ``ru'' are also provided. The cmavo ``ra''
    repeats a recently used sumti, and ``ru'' one that was further back in the speech or
    text. The use of ``ra'' and ``ru'' forces the listener to guess at the referent, but
    makes life easier for the speaker. Can ``ra'' refer to the last sumti, like ``ri''?
    The answer is no if ``ri'' has also been used. If ``ri'' has not been used, then
    ``ra'' might be the last sumti. Likewise, if ``ra'' has been used, then any use of
    ``ru'' would repeat a sumti earlier than the one ``ra'' is repeating. A more
    reasonable version of Example 6.5, but one that depends more on context, is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  lo smuci .i lo forca .i la rik. pilno ra
        .i la .alis. pilno ru
    A spoon.  A fork.  Rick uses [some previous thing].
        Alice uses [some more remote thing].
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e6d6">Example 6.6</a>, the use of ``ra'' tells us that something
    other than ``la rik.'' is the antecedent; ``lo forca'' is the nearest sumti, so it is
    probably the antecedent. Similarly, the antecedent of ``ru'' must be something even
    further back in the utterance than ``lo forca'', and ``lo smuci'' is the obvious
    candidate.</p>

    <p>The meaning of ``ri'' must be determined every time it is used. Since ``ra'' and
    ``ru'' are more vaguely defined, they may well retain the same meaning for a while,
    but the listener cannot count on this behavior. To make a permanent reference to
    something repeated by ``ri'', ``ra'', or ``ru'', use ``goi'' and a ko'a-series
    cmavo:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  la .alis. klama le zarci
        .i ri goi ko'a blanu
    Alice goes-to the store.
        It-last-mentioned also-known-as it-1 is-blue.
</pre>allows the store to be referred to henceforth as ``ko'a'' without ambiguity.
<a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a> is equivalent to <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> and
eliminates any possibility of ``ko'a'' being interpreted by the listener as referring to
Alice.

    <p>The cmavo ``go'i'', ``go'a'', and ``go'u'' follow exactly the same rules as
    ``ri'', ``ra'', and ``ru'', except that they are pro-bridi, and therefore repeat
    bridi, not sumti --- specifically, main sentence bridi. Any bridi that are embedded
    within other bridi, such as relative clauses or abstractions, are not counted. Like
    the cmavo of the broda-series, the cmavo of the go'i-series copy all sumti with them.
    This makes ``go'i'' by itself convenient for answering a question affirmatively, or
    for repeating the last bridi, possibly with new sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  xu zo djan. cmene do
        .i go'i
    [True-false?] The-word ``John'' is-the-name of you?

    Is John your name?  Yes.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>   mi klama le zarci .i do go'i
    I go-to the store.  You [repeat last bridi].
    I go to the store.  You, too.
</pre>Note that <a href="#e6d9">Example 6.9</a> means the same as <a href="#e5d6">Example
5.6</a>, but without the bother of assigning an actual broda-series word to the first
bridi. For long-term reference, use ``go'i cei broda'' or the like, analogously to ``ri
goi ko'a'' in <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a>.

    <p>The remaining four cmavo of the go'i-series are provided for convenience or for
    achieving special effects. The cmavo ``go'e'' means the same as ``go'ixire'': it
    repeats the last bridi but one. This is useful in conversation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d10" name="e6d10">6.10)</a>    A: mi ba klama le zarci
    B: mi nelci le si'o mi go'i
    A: do go'e

    A: I [future] go-to the store.
    B: I like the concept-of I [repeat last bridi].
    A: You [repeat last bridi but one].

    A: I am going to the store.
    B: I like the idea of my going.
    A: You'll go, too.
</pre>

    <p>Here B's sentence repeats A's within an abstraction (explained in Chapter 11):
    ``le si'o mi go'i'' means ``le si'o mi klama le zarci''. Why must B use the word
    ``mi'' explicitly to replace the x1 of ``mi klama le zarci'', even though it looks
    like ``mi'' is replacing ``mi''? Because B's ``mi'' refers to B, whereas A's ``mi''
    refers to A. If B said:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d11" name="e6d11">6.11)</a>    mi nelci le si'o go'i
</pre>that would mean:

    <dl>
      <dd>I like the idea of your going to the store.</dd>
    </dl>The repetition implied by ``go'i'' is not literally by words, but by concepts.
    Finally, A repeats her own sentence, but with the x1 changed to ``do'', meaning B.
    Note that in <a href="#e6d10">Example 6.10</a>, the tense ``ba'' (future time) is
    carried along by both ``go'i'' and ``go'e''.

    <p>Descriptions based on go'i-series cmavo can be very useful for repeating specific
    sumti of previous bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d12" name="e6d12">6.12)</a>    le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci
        .i le go'i cu

            walks-on the ice.
    The black cat goes to the store.  It walks on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ``go'i'' repeats ``le xekri mlatu cu klama le zarci'', and since ``le''
    makes the x1 place into a description, and the x1 place of this bridi is ``le xekri
    mlatu'', ``le go'i'' means ``le xekri mlatu''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``go'o'', ``nei'', and ``no'a'' have been little used so far. They
    repeat respectively some future bridi, the current bridi, and the bridi that encloses
    the current bridi (``no'a'', unlike the other members of the go'i- series, can repeat
    non-sentence bridi). Here are a few examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d13" name="e6d13">6.13)</a>    mi nupre le nu mi go'o

        [Future] give the house to-the daughter
    I promise to do the following:
        Give the money to my son.
        Give the house to my daughter.
</pre>(Note: The Lojban does not contain an equivalent of the ``my'' in the colloquial
English; it leaves the fact that it is the speaker's son and daughter that are referred
to implicit. To make the fact explicit, use ``le bersa/tixnu be mi''.)

    <p>For good examples of ``nei'' and ``no'a'', we need nested bridi contexts:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d14" name="e6d14">6.14)</a>    mi se pluka le nu do pensi
        le nu nei kei
        pu le nu do zukte
    I am-pleased-by the event-of (you think-about
        (the event-of [main bridi])
        before the-event of (your acting).
    I am pleased that you thought about whether I
        would be pleased (about ... ) before you acted.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d15" name="e6d15">6.15)</a> mi ba klama ca le nu
        do no'a
    I [future] go [present] the event-of
        you [repeats outer bridi]
    I will go when you do.
</pre>Finally, ``ra'o'' is a cmavo that can be appended to any go'i-series cmavo, or
indeed any cmavo of selma'o GOhA, to signal that pro-sumti or pro-bridi cmavo in the
antecedent are to be repeated literally and reinterpreted in their new context. Normally,
any pro-sumti used within the antecedent of the pro-bridi keep their meanings intact. In
the presence of ``ra'o'', however, their meanings must be reinterpreted with reference to
the new environment. If someone says to you:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d16" name="e6d16">6.16)</a>    mi ba lumci lemi karca
    I will wash my car.
</pre>you might reply either:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d17" name="e6d17">6.17)</a>    mi go'i
    I will wash your car.
</pre>or:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d18" name="e6d18">6.18)</a>    mi go'i ra'o
    I will wash my car.
</pre>

    <p>The ``ra'o'' forces the second ``mi'' from the original bridi to mean the new
    speaker rather than the former speaker. This means that ``go'e ra'o'' would be an
    acceptable alternative to ``do go'e'' in B's statement in <a href="#e6d10">Example
    6.10</a>.</p>

    <p>The anaphoric pro-sumti of this section can be used in quotations, but never refer
    to any of the supporting text outside the quotation, since speakers presumably do not
    know that they may be quoted by someone else.</p>

    <p>However, a ``ri''-series or ``go'a''-series reference within a quotation can refer
    to something mentioned in an earlier quotation if the two quotations are closely
    related in time and context. This allows a quotation to be broken up by narrative
    material without interfering with the pro-sumti within it. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e6d19" name="e6d19">6.19)</a>    la djan. cusku lu mi klama le zarci li'u
        .i la .alis. cusku lu mi go'i li'u
    John says [quote] I go-to the store [unquote].
        Alice says [quote] I [repeat] [unquote].
    John says, ``I am going to the store.''
        Alice says, ``Me too.''
</pre>Of course, there is no problem with narrative material referring to something
within a quotation: people who quote, unlike people who are quoted, are aware of what
they are doing.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s7" name="s7">7. Indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi: the zo'e-series and
    the co'e-series</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s7" name="s7">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s7" name="s7">   zo'e    KOhA    zo'e-series the obvious value
    zu'i    KOhA    zo'e-series the typical value
    zi'o    KOhA    zo'e-series the nonexistent value
    co'e    GOhA    co'e-series has the obvious relationship
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s7" name="s7">The cmavo of the zo'e-series represent indefinite, unspecified
sumti. The cmavo ``zo'e'' represents an elliptical value for this sumti place; it is the
optional spoken place holder when a sumti is skipped without being specified. Note that
the elliptical value is not always the typical value. The properties of ellipsis lead to
an elliptical sumti being defined as ``whatever I want it to mean but haven't bothered to
figure out, or figure out how to express''.</a>

    <p>The cmavo ``zu'i'', on the other hand, represents the typical value for this place
    of this bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi klama le bartu be le zdani
        le nenri be le zdani
        zu'i zu'i
    I go to-the outside of the house
        from-the inside of the house
        [by-typical-route] [by-typical-means]
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>, the first ``zu'i'' probably means something
    like ``by the door'', and the second ``zu'i'' probably means something like ``on
    foot'', those being the typical route and means for leaving a house. On the other
    hand, if you are at the top of a high rise during a fire, neither ``zu'i'' is
    appropriate. It's also common to use ``zu'i'' in ``by standard'' places.</p>

    <p>Finally, the cmavo ``zi'o'' represents a value which does not even exist. When a
    bridi fills one of its places with ``zi'o'', what is really meant is that the selbri
    has a place which is irrelevant to the true relationship the speaker wishes to
    express. For example, the place structure of ``zbasu'' is</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>actor x1 makes x2 from materials x3</dd>
    </dl>Consider the sentence

    <dl>
      <dd>Living things are made from cells.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This cannot be correctly expressed as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  loi jmive cu se zbasu [zo'e] fi loi selci
    The-mass-of living-things is-made [by-something]
        from the-mass-of cells
</pre>because the ``zo'e'', expressed or understood, in <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a>
indicates that there is still a ``maker'' in this relationship. We do not generally
suppose, however, that someone ``makes'' living things from cells. The best answer is
probably to find a different selbri, one which does not imply a ``maker'': however, an
alternative strategy is to use ``zi'o'' to eliminate the maker place:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  loi jmive cu se zbasu zi'o
        loi selci
    The-mass-of living-things is-made [without-maker]
        from the-mass-of cells.
</pre>Note: The use of ``zi'o'' to block up, as it were, one place of a selbri actually
creates a new selbri with a different place structure. Consider the following examples:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  mi zbasu le dinju loi mudri
    I make the building from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    I make the building out of wood.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>   zi'o zbasu le dinju
        loi mudri
    [without-maker] makes the building
        from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    The building is made out of wood.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>   mi zbasu zi'o
        loi mudri
    I make [without-thing-made]
        from-some-of-the-mass-of wood.
    I build using wood.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>   mi zbasu loi mudri zi'o
    I make the building [without-material].
    I make the building.
</pre>

    <p>If <a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a> is true, then <a href="#e7d5">Examples 7.5</a>
    through <a href="#e7d7">7.7</a> must be true also. However, <a href="#e7d3">Example
    7.3</a> does not correspond to any sentence with three regular (non-``zi'o'')
    sumti.</p>

    <p>The pro-bridi ``co'e'' (which by itself constitutes the co'e-series of selma'o
    GOhA) represents the elliptical selbri. Lojban grammar does not allow the speaker to
    merely omit a selbri from a bridi, although any or all sumti may be freely omitted.
    Being vague about a relationship requires the use of ``co'e'' as a selbri
    place-holder:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  mi troci le nu
        mi co'e le vorme
    I try the event-of
        my [doing-the-obvious-action] to-the door.
    I try the door.
</pre>

    <p>The English version means, and the Lojban version probably means, that I try to
    open the door, but the relationship of opening is not actually specified; the
    Lojbanic listener must guess it from context. Lojban, unlike English, makes it clear
    that there is an implicit action that is not being expressed.</p>

    <p>The form of ``co'e'' was chosen to resemble ``zo'e''; the cmavo ``do'e'' of
    selma'o BAI (see <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>) also belongs to the same
    group of cmavo.</p>

    <p>Note that ``do'i'', of the di'u-series, is also a kind of indefinite pro-sumti: it
    is indefinite in referent, but is restricted to referring only to an utterance.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s8" name="s8">8. Reflexive and reciprocal pro-sumti: the

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s8" name="s8">The cmavo of the vo'a-series are pro-sumti anaphora, like
those of the ri-series, but have a specific function. These cmavo refer to the other
places of the same bridi; the five of them represent up to five places. The same
vo'a-series cmavo mean different things in different bridi. Some examples:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi lumci vo'a
    I wash myself
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  mi klama le zarci vo'e
    I go to the store from itself
        [by some route unspecified].
</pre>To refer to places of neighboring bridi, constructions like ``le se go'i ku'' do
the job: this refers to the 2nd place of the previous main bridi, as explained in
    <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>.

    <p>The cmavo of the vo'a-series are also used with ``soi'' (of selma'o SOI) to
    precisely express reciprocity, which in English is imprecisely expressed with a
    discursive phrase like ``vice versa'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi prami do
        soi vo'a vo'e
    I love you
        [reciprocity] [x1 of this bridi]
        [x2 of this bridi].
    I love you and vice versa (swapping ``I'' and ``you'').
</pre>The significance of ``soi vo'a vo'e'' is that the bridi is still true even if the
x1 (specified by ``vo'a'') and the x2 (specified by ``vo'e'') places are interchanged. If
only a single sumti follows ``soi'', then the sumti immediately preceding ``soi'' is
understood to be one of those involved:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  mi prami do soi vo'a
    I love you [reciprocity] [x1 of this bridi].
</pre>again involves the x1 and x2 places.

    <p>Of course, other places can be involved, and other sumti may be used in place of
    vo'a-series cmavo, provided those other sumti can be reasonably understood as
    referring to the same things mentioned in the bridi proper. Here are several examples
    that mean the same thing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi bajra ti ta soi vo'e
    mi bajra ti ta soi vo'e vo'i
    soi vo'e vo'i mi bajra ti ta
    I run to this from that and vice versa
        (to that from this).
</pre>The elidable terminator for ``soi'' is ``se'u'' (selma'o SEhU), which is normally
needed only if there is just one sumti after the ``soi'', and the ``soi'' construction is
not at the end of the bridi. Constructions using ``soi'' are free modifiers, and as such
can go almost anywhere. Here is an example where ``se'u'' is required:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  mi bajykla ti
        soi vo'i se'u ta

other words, once we know the referent of a pro-sumti or pro-bridi, how long can we be
sure that future uses of the same cmavo have the same referent? The answer to this
question depends on which series the cmavo belongs to.</a>

    <p>Personal pro-sumti are stable until there is a change of speaker or listener,
    possibly signaled by a vocative. Assignable pro-sumti and pro-bridi last indefinitely
    or until rebound with ``goi'' or ``cei''. Bound variable pro-sumti and pro-bridi also
    generally last until re-bound; details are available in <a href=

    <p>Utterance pro-sumti are stable only within the utterance in which they appear;
    similarly, reflexive pro-sumti are stable only within the bridi in which they appear;
    and ``ke'a'' is stable only within its relative clause. Anaphoric pro-sumti and
    pro-bridi are stable only within narrow limits depending on the rules for the
    particular cmavo.</p>

    <p>Demonstrative pro-sumti, indefinite pro-sumti and pro-bridi, and sumti and bridi
    questions potentially change referents every time they are used.</p>

    <p>However, there are ways to cancel all pro-sumti and pro-bridi, so that none of
    them have known referents. (Some, such as ``mi'', will acquire the same referent as
    soon as they are used again after the cancellation.) The simplest way to cancel
    everything is with the cmavo ``da'o'' of selma'o DAhO, which is used solely for this
    purpose; it may appear anywhere, and has no effect on the grammar of texts containing
    it. One use of ``da'o'' is when entering a conversation, to indicate that one's
    pro-sumti assignments have nothing to do with any assignments already made by other
    participants in the conversation.</p>

    <p>In addition, the cmavo ``ni'o'' and ``no'i'' of selma'o NIhO, which are used
    primarily to indicate shifts in topic, may also have the effect of canceling
    pro-sumti and pro-bridi assignments, or of reinstating ones formerly in effect. More
    explanations of NIhO can be found in <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s14" name="s14">14. The identity predicate: du</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s14" name="s14">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s14" name="s14">   du  GOhA            identity
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s14" name="s14">The cmavo ``du'' has the place structure:</a>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is identical with x2, x3, ...</dd>
    </dl>and appears in selma'o GOhA for reasons of convenience: it is not a pro-bridi.
    ``du'' serves as mathematical ``='', and outside mathematical contexts is used for
    defining or identifying. Mathematical examples may be found in <a href=
    "chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>.

    <p>The main difference between</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e14d1" name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    ko'a du le nanmu
    it-1 is-identical-to the man
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    ko'a mintu le nanmu
    it-1 is-the-same-as the man
</pre>is this defining nature. <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> presumes that the
speaker is responding to a request for information about what ``ko'a'' refers to, or that
the speaker in some way feels the need to define ``ko'a'' for later reference. A bridi
with ``du'' is an identity sentence, somewhat metalinguistically saying that all attached
sumti are representations for the same referent. There may be any number of sumti
associated with ``du'', and all are said to be identical.

    <p><a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a>, however, predicates; it is used to make a claim
    about the identity of ``ko'a'', which presumably has been defined previously.</p>

    <p>Note: ``du'' historically is derived from ``dunli'', but ``dunli'' has a third
    place which ``du'' lacks: the standard of equality.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s15" name="s15">15. lujvo based on pro-sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-s15" name="s15">There exist rafsi allocated to a few cmavo of selma'o KOhA,
    but they are rarely used. (See</a> <a href="#s16">Section 16</a> for a complete
    list.) The obvious way to use them is as internal sumti, filling in an appropriate
    place of the gismu or lujvo to which they are attached; as such, they usually stand
    as the first rafsi in their lujvo.</p>

    <p>Thus ``donta'a'', meaning ``you-talk'', would be interpreted as ``tavla be do'',
    and would have the place structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e15d1" name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    t1 talks to you about subject t3 in language t4
</pre>since t2 (the addressee) is already known to be ``do''.

    <p>On the other hand, the lujvo ``donma'o'', literally ``you-cmavo'', which means ``a
    second person personal pronoun'', would be interpreted as ``cmavo be zo do'', and
    have the place structure:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    c1 is a second person pronoun in language c4
</pre>since both the c2 place (the grammatical class) and the c3 place (the meaning) are
obvious from the context ``do''.

    <p>An anticipated use of rafsi for cmavo in the ``fo'a'' series is to express terjvo
    which can't be expressed in a convenient rafsi form, because they are too long to
    express, or are formally inconvenient (fu'ivla, cmene, and so forth.) An example
    would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-7-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    fo'a goi le kulnrsu,omi .i lo fo'arselsanga
    x6 stands for Finnish-culture.  An x6-song
</pre>Finally, lujvo involving ``zi'o'' are also possible, and are fully discussed in
<a href="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a>. In brief, the convention is to use the rafsi for
``zi'o'' as a prefix immediately followed by the rafsi for the number of the place to be
deleted. Thus, if we consider a beverage (something drunk without considering who, if
anyone, drinks it) as a ``se pinxe be zi'o'', the lujvo corresponding to this is
``zilrelselpinxe'' (deleting the second place of ``se pinxe''). Deleting the x1 place in
this fashion would move all remaining places up by one. This would mean that
``zilpavypinxe'' has the same place structure as ``zilrelselpinxe'', and ``lo
zilpavypinxe'', like ``lo zilrelselpinxe'', refers to a beverage, and not to a
non-existent drinker.

    <p>The pro-bridi ``co'e'', ``du'', and ``bu'a'' also have rafsi, which can be used
    just as if they were gismu. The resulting lujvo have (except for ``du''-based lujvo)
    highly context-dependent meanings.</p>

    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s1" name="s1">1. What are you pointing at?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s1" name="s1">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s1" name="s1">   poi NOI restrictive relative clause introducer
    ke'a    GOhA    relative pro-sumti
    ku'o    KUhO    relative clause terminator
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s1" name="s1">Let us think about the problem of communicating what it is
that we are pointing at when we are pointing at something. In Lojban, we can refer to
what we are pointing at by using the pro-sumti ``ti'' if it is nearby, or ``ta'' if it is
somewhat further away, or ``tu'' if it is distant. (Pro-sumti are explained in full
in</a> <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>.)

    <p>However, even with the assistance of a pointing finger, or pointing lips, or
    whatever may be appropriate in the local culture, it is often hard for a listener to
    tell just what is being pointed at. Suppose one is pointing at a person (in
    particular, in the direction of his or her face), and says:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  ti cu barda
    This-one is-big.
</pre>

    <p>What is the referent of ``ti''? Is it the person? Or perhaps it is the person's
    nose? Or even (for ``ti'' can be plural as well as singular, and mean ``these ones''
    as well as ``this one'') the pores on the person's nose?</p>

    <p>To help solve this problem, Lojban uses a construction called a ``relative
    clause''. Relative clauses are usually attached to the end of sumti, but there are
    other places where they can go as well, as explained later in this chapter. A
    relative clause begins with a word of selma'o NOI, and ends with the elidable
    terminator ``ku'o'' (of selma'o KUhO). As you might suppose, ``noi'' is a cmavo of
    selma'o NOI; however, first we will discuss the cmavo ``poi'', which also belongs to
    selma'o NOI.</p>

    <p>In between the ``poi'' and the ``ku'o'' appears a full bridi, with the same syntax
    as any other bridi. Anywhere within the bridi of a relative clause, the pro-sumti
    ``ke'a'' (of selma'o KOhA) may be used, and it stands for the sumti to which the
    relative clause is attached (called the ``relativized sumti''). Here are some
    examples before we go any further:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  ti poi ke'a prenu ku'o cu barda
    This-thing such-that( IT is-a-person ) is-large.
    This thing which is a person is big.
    This person is big.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  ti poi ke'a nazbi ku'o cu barda
    This-thing such-that( IT is-a-nose ) is-large.
    This thing which is a nose is big.
    This nose is big.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  ti poi ke'a nazbi kapkevna ku'o
        cu barda
    This-thing such-that( IT is-a-nose-type-of skin-hole )
        is-big.
    These things which are nose-pores are big.
    These nose-pores are big.
</pre>In the literal translations throughout this chapter, the word ``IT'', capitalized,
is used to represent the cmavo ``ke'a''. In each case, it serves to represent the sumti
(in <a href="#e1d2">Examples 1.2</a> through <a href="#e1d4">1.4</a>, the cmavo ``ti'')
to which the relative clause is attached.

    <p>Of course, there is no reason why ``ke'a'' needs to appear in the x1 place of a
    relative clause bridi; it can appear in any place, or indeed even in a sub-bridi
    within the relative clause bridi. Here are two more examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu ke'a ku'o
        cu ratcu
    That-distant-thing such-that( the cat [past] drags IT )
        is-a-rat.
    That thing which the cat dragged is a rat.
    What the cat dragged is a rat.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>   ta poi mi djica le nu mi ponse ke'a [kei] ku'o
        cu bloti
    That-thing such-that( I desire the event-of( I own IT ) )
        is-a-boat.
    That thing that I want to own is a boat.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e1d6">Example 1.6</a>, ``ke'a'' appears in an abstraction clause
    (abstractions are explained in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>) within a
    relative clause.</p>

    <p>Like any sumti, ``ke'a'' can be omitted. The usual presumption in that case is
    that it then falls into the x1 place:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d7" name="e1d7">1.7)</a>  ti poi nazbi cu barda
    This-thing which is-a-nose is-big.
</pre>almost certainly means the same thing as <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a>. However,
``ke'a'' can be omitted if it is clear to the listener that it belongs in some place
other than x1:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d8" name="e1d8">1.8)</a>  tu poi le mlatu pu lacpu cu ratcu
    That-distant-thing which the cat drags is-a-rat
</pre>is equivalent to <a href="#e1d4">Example 1.4</a>.

    <p>As stated before, ``ku'o'' is an elidable terminator, and in fact it is almost
    always elidable. Throughout the rest of this chapter, ``ku'o'' will not be written in
    any of the examples unless it is absolutely required: thus, <a href="#e1d2">Example
    1.2</a> can be written:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d9" name="e1d9">1.9)</a>  ti poi prenu cu barda
    That which is-a-person is-big.
    That person is big.
</pre>without any change in meaning. Note that ``poi'' is translated ``which'' rather
than ``such-that'' when ``ke'a'' has been omitted from the x1 place of the relative
clause bridi. The word ``which'' is used in English to introduce English relative
clauses: other words that can be used are ``who'' and ``that'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d10" name="e1d10">1.10)</a>    I saw a man who was going to the store.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e1d11" name=
"e1d11">1.11)</a>    The building that the school was located in is large.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e1d10">Example 1.10</a> the relative clause is ``who was going to the
    store'', and in <a href="#e1d11">Example 1.11</a> it is ``that the school was located
    in''. Sometimes ``who'', ``which'', and ``that'' are used in literal translations in
    this chapter in order to make them read more smoothly.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s2" name="s2">2. Incidental relative clauses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s2" name="s2">   noi NOI incidental relative clause introducer
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s2" name="s2">There are two basic kinds of relative clauses: restrictive
relative clauses introduced by ``poi'', and incidental (sometimes called simply
``non-restrictive'') relative clauses introduced by ``noi''. The difference between
restrictive and incidental relative clauses is that restrictive clauses provide
information that is essential to identifying the referent of the sumti to which they are
attached, whereas incidental relative clauses provide additional information which is
helpful to the listener but is not essential for identifying the referent of the sumti.
All of the examples in</a> <a href="#s1">Section 1</a> are restrictive relative clauses:
the information in the relative clause is essential to identification. (The title of this
chapter, though, uses an incidental relative clause.)

    <p>Consider the following examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  le gerku poi blanu cu barda
    The dog which is-blue is-large.
    The dog which is blue is large.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   le gerku noi blanu cu barda
    The dog incidentally-which is-blue is-large.
    The dog, which is blue, is large.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>, the information conveyed by ``poi blanu'' is
    essential to identifying the dog in question: it restricts the possible referents
    from dogs in general to dogs that are blue. This is why ``poi'' relative clauses are
    called restrictive. In <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a>, on the other hand, the dog
    which is referred to has presumably already been identified clearly, and the relative
    clause ``noi blanu'' just provides additional information about it. (If in fact the
    dog hasn't been identified clearly, then the relative clause does not help identify
    it further.)</p>

    <p>In English, the distinction between restrictive and incidental relative clauses is
    expressed in writing by surrounding incidental, but not restrictive, clauses with
    commas. These commas are functioning as parentheses, because incidental relative
    clauses are essentially parenthetical. This distinction in punctuation is represented
    in speech by a difference in tone of voice. In addition, English restrictive relative
    clauses can be introduced by ``that'' as well as ``which'' and ``who'', whereas
    incidental relative clauses cannot begin with ``that''. Lojban, however, always uses
    the cmavo ``poi'' and ``noi'' rather than punctuation or intonation to make the
    distinction.</p>

    <p>Here are more examples of incidental relative clauses:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  mi noi jdice cu zvati
    I who-incidentally am-a-judge am-at [some-place].
    I, a judge, am present.
</pre>

    <p>In this example, ``mi'' is already sufficiently restricted, and the additional
    information that I am a judge is being provided solely for the listener's

    [True?] You see my car incidentally-which is-white.
    Do you see my car, which is white?
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a>, the speaker is presumed to have only one car,
    and is providing incidental information that it is white. (Alternatively, he or she
    might have more than one car, since ``le karce'' can be plural, in which case the
    incidental information is that each of them is white.) Contrast <a href=
    "#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> with a restrictive relative clause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  xu do viska le mi karce poi blabi
    [True?] You see my car which is-white.
    Do you see my car that is white?
    Do you see my white car?
</pre>Here the speaker probably has several cars, and is restricting the referent of the
sumti ``le mi karce'' (and thereby the listener's attention) to the white one only.
<a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> means much the same as <a href="#e2d6">Example 2.6</a>,
which does not use a relative clause:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  xu do viska le mi blabi karce
    [True?] You see my white car.
    Do you see my car, the white one?
</pre>So a restrictive relative clause attached to a description can often mean the same
as a description involving a tanru. However, ``blabi karce'', like all tanru, is somewhat
vague: in principle, it might refer to a car which carries white things, or even express
some more complicated concept involving whiteness and car-ness; the restrictive relative
clause of <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> can only refer to a car which is white, not to
any more complex or extended concept.

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s3" name="s3">There are types of relative clauses (those which have a
certain selbri) which are frequently wanted in Lojban, and can be expressed using a
shortcut called a relative phrase. Relative phrases are introduced by cmavo of selma'o
GOI, and consist of a GOI cmavo followed by a single sumti.</a>

    <p>Here is an example of ``pe'', plus an equivalent sentence using a relative
    clause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  le stizu pe mi cu blanu
    The chair associated-with me is-blue.
    My chair is blue.

</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> and <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>, the link
    between the chair and the speaker is of the loosest kind.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of ``po'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  le stizu po mi cu xunre
    The chair specific-to me is red.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>   le stizu poi
        ke'a se steci srana mi cu xunre
    The chair such-that
        (IT is-specifically associated-with me) is-red.
</pre><a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> and <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> contrast with
<a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> and <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>: the chair is more
permanently connected with the speaker. A plausible (though not the only possible)
contrast between <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> and <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> is
that ``pe mi'' would be appropriate for a chair the speaker is currently sitting on
(whether or not the speaker owned that chair), and ``po mi'' for a chair owned by the
speaker (whether or not he or she was currently occupying it).

    <p>As a result, the relationship expressed between two sumti by ``po'' is usually
    called ``possession'', although it does not necessarily imply ownership, legal or
    otherwise. The central concept is that of specificity (``steci'' in Lojban).</p>

    <p>Here is an example of ``po'e'', as well as another example of ``po'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  le birka po'e mi cu spofu
    The arm intrinsically-possessed-by me is-broken

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>   le birka poi
        jinzi ke se steci srana mi
        cu spofu
    The arm which
        is-intrinsically (specifically associated-with) me
        is-broken

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>   le botpi po mi cu spofu
    The bottle specific-to me is-broken
</pre><a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a> and <a href="#e3d6">Example 3.6</a> on the one
hand, and <a href="#e3d7">Example 3.7</a> on the other, illustrate the contrast between
two types of possession called ``intrinsic'' and ``extrinsic'', or sometimes
``inalienable'' and ``alienable'', respectively. Something is intrinsically (or
inalienably) possessed by someone if the possession is part of the possessor, and cannot
be changed without changing the possessor. In the case of <a href="#e3d5">Example
3.5</a>, people are usually taken to intrinsically possess their arms: even if an arm is
cut off, it remains the arm of that person. (If the arm is transplanted to another
person, however, it becomes intrinsically possessed by the new user, though, so intrinsic
possession is a matter of degree.)

    <p>By contrast, the bottle of <a href="#e3d7">Example 3.7</a> can be given away, or
    thrown away, or lost, or stolen, so it is possessed extrinsically (alienably). The
    exact line between intrinsic and extrinsic possession is culturally dependent. The
    U.S. Declaration of Independence speaks of the ``inalienable rights'' of men, but
    just what those rights are, and even whether the concept makes sense at all, varies
    from culture to culture.</p>

    <p>Note that <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a> can also be expressed without a relative
    clause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>  le birka be mi cu spofu
    The arm of-body me is broken
</pre>reflecting the fact that the gismu ``birka'' has an x2 place representing the body
to which the arm belongs. Many, but not all, cases of intrinsic possession can be thus
covered without using ``po'e'' by placing the possessor into the appropriate place of the
description selbri.

    <p>Here is an example of ``po'u'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  le gerku po'u le mi pendo cu cinba mi
    The dog which-is my friend kisses me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d10" name="e3d10">3.10)</a> le gerku poi du le mi pendo cu cinba mi
    The dog which = my friend kisses me.
</pre>The cmavo ``po'u'' does not represent possession at all, but rather identity. (Note
that it means ``poi du'' and its form was chosen to suggest the relationship.)

    <p>In <a href="#e3d9">Example 3.9</a>, the use of ``po'u'' tells us that ``le gerku''
    and ``le mi pendo'' represent the same thing. Consider the contrast between <a href=
    "#e3d9">Example 3.9</a> and:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d11" name="e3d11">3.11)</a>    le mi pendo po'u le gerku cu cinba mi
    My friend which-is the dog kisses me.
</pre>The facts of the case are the same, but the listener's knowledge about the
situation may not be. In <a href="#e3d9">Example 3.9</a>, the listener is presumed not to
understand which dog is meant by ``le gerku'', so the speaker adds a relative phrase
clarifying that it is the particular dog which is the speaker's friend.

    <p><a href="#e3d11">Example 3.11</a>, however, assumes that the listener does not
    know which of the speaker's friends is referred to, and specifies that it is the
    friend that is the dog (which dog is taken to be obvious). Here is another example of
    the same contrast:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d12" name="e3d12">3.12)</a>    le tcadu po'u la nu,iork
    The city of New York [not another city].

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d13" name="e3d13">3.13)</a> la nu,iork po'u le tcadu
    New York the city (not the state or some other New York)
</pre>The principle that the possessor and the possessed may change places applies to all
the GOI cmavo, and allows for the possibility of odd effects:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d14" name="e3d14">3.14)</a>    le kabri pe le mi pendo cu cmalu
    The cup associated-with my friend is small.
    My friend's cup is small
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d15" name="e3d15">3.15)</a>    le mi pendo pe le kabri cu cmalu
    My friend associated-with the cup is small.
    My friend, the one with the cup, is small.
</pre><a href="#e3d14">Example 3.14</a> is useful in a context which is about my friend,
and states that his or her cup is small, whereas <a href="#e3d15">Example 3.15</a> is
useful in a context that is primarily about a certain cup, and makes a claim about ``my
friend of the cup'', as opposed to some other friend of mine. Here the cup appears to
``possess'' the person! English can't even express this relationship with a possessive
--- ``the cup's friend of mine'' looks like nonsense --- but Lojban has no trouble doing
so.

    <p>Finally, the cmavo ``ne'' and ``no'u'' stand to ``pe'' and ``po'u'', respectively,
    as ``noi'' does to ``poi'' --- they provide incidental information:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d16" name="e3d16">3.16)</a>    le blabi gerku ne mi cu batci do
    The white dog, incidentally-associated-with me,
        bites you.
    The white dog, which is mine, bites you.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d16">Example 3.16</a>, the white dog is already fully identified
    (after all, presumably the listener know which dog bit him or her!). The fact that it
    is yours is merely incidental to the main bridi claim.</p>

    <p>Distinguishing between ``po'u'' and ``no'u'' can be a little tricky. Consider a
    room with several men in it, one of whom is named Jim. If you don't know their names,
    I might say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d17" name="e3d17">3.17)</a>    le nanmu no'u la djim. cu terpemci
    The man, incidentally-who-is Jim, is-a-poet.
    The man, Jim, is a poet.
</pre>

    <p>Here I am saying that one of the men is a poet, and incidentally telling you that
    he is Jim. But if you do know the names, then</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d18" name="e3d18">3.18)</a>    le nanmu po'u la djim. cu terpemci
    The man who-is Jim is-a-poet.
    The man, the one named Jim, is a poet.
</pre>is appropriate. Now I am using the fact that the man I am speaking of is Jim in
order to pick out which man I mean.

    <p>It is worth mentioning that English sometimes over-specifies possession from the
    Lojban point of view (and the point of view of many other languages, including ones
    closely related to English). The idiomatic English sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d19" name="e3d19">3.19)</a>    The man put his hands in his pockets.
</pre>seems strange to a French- or German-speaking person: whose pockets would he put
his hands into? and even odder, whose hands would he put into his pockets? In Lojban, the
sentence
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e3d20" name="e3d20">3.20)</a>    le nanmu cu punji le xanci le daski
    The man puts the hand at-locus-the pocket.
</pre>is very natural. Of course, if the man is in fact putting his hands into another's
pockets, or another's hands into his pockets, the fact can be specified.

    <p>Finally, the elidable terminator for GOI cmavo is ``ge'u'' of selma'o GEhU; it is
    almost never required. However, if a logical connective immediately follows a sumti
    modified by a relative phrase, then an explicit ``ge'u'' is needed to allow the
    connective to affect the relativized sumti rather than the sumti of the relative
    phrase. (What about the cmavo after which selma'o GOI is named? It is discussed in
    <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>, as it is not semantically akin to the other
    kinds of relative phrases, although the syntax is the same.)</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s4" name="s4">4. Multiple relative clauses: ``zi'e''</a></h2>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s4" name="s4">   zi'e    ZIhE        relative clause joiner
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s4" name="s4">Sometimes it is necessary or useful to attach more than one
relative clause to a sumti. This is made possible in Lojban by the cmavo ``zi'e'' (of
selma'o ZIhE), which is used to join one or more relative clauses together into a single
unit, thus making them apply to the same sumti. For example:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  le gerku poi blabi zi'e poi batci le nanmu cu klama
    The dog which is white and which bites the man goes.
</pre>The most usual translation of ``zi'e'' in English is ``and'', but ``zi'e'' is not
really a logical connective: unlike most of the true logical connectives (which are
explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>), it cannot be converted into a
logical connection between sentences.

    <p>It is perfectly correct to use ``zi'e'' to connect relative clauses of different
    kinds:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  le gerku poi blabi zi'e noi
        le mi pendo cu ponse ke'a cu klama
    The dog that-is( white) and incidentally-such-that(
        my friend owns IT) goes.
    The dog that is white, which my friend owns,
        is going.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>, the restrictive clause ``poi blabi'' specifies
    which dog is referred to, but the incidental clause ``noi le mi pendo cu ponse'' is
    mere incidental information: the listener is supposed to already have identified the
    dog from the ``poi blabi''. Of course, the meaning (though not necessarily the
    emphasis) is the same if the incidental clause appears first.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to connect relative phrases with ``zi'e'', or a relative
    phrase with a relative clause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  le botpi po mi zi'e poi blanu cu spofu
    The bottle specific-to me and which-is blue is-broken.
    My blue bottle is broken.
</pre>

    <p>Note that if the colloquial translation of <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> were
    ``My bottle, which is blue, is broken'', then ``noi'' rather than ``poi'' would have
    been correct in the Lojban version, since that version of the English implies that
    you do not need to know the bottle is blue. As written, <a href="#e4d3">Example
    4.3</a> suggests that I probably have more than one bottle, and the one in question
    needs to be picked out as the blue one.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  mi ba zutse le stizu pe mi
        zi'e po do zi'e poi xunre
    I [future] sit-in the chair associated-with me and
        specific-to you and which-is red.
    I will sit in my chair (really yours), the red one.
</pre><a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> illustrates that more than two relative phrases or
clauses can be connected with ``zi'e''. It almost defies colloquial translation because
of the very un-English contrast between ``pe mi'', implying that the chair is temporarily
connected with me, and ``po do'', implying that the chair has a more permanent
association with you. (Perhaps I am a guest in your house, in which case the chair would
naturally be your property.)

    <p>Here is another example, mixing a relative phrase and two relative clauses, a
    restrictive one and a non-restrictive one:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  mi ba citka le dembi pe mi

fundamental difference between ``poi'' and ``voi'' relative clauses. A ``poi'' relative
clause is said to be veridical, in the same sense that a description using ``lo'' or
``loi'' is: it is essential to the interpretation that the bridi actually be true. For
example:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  le gerku poi blabi cu klama
    The dog which is-white goes.
</pre>it must actually be true that the dog is white, or the sentence constitutes a
miscommunication. If there is a white dog and a brown dog, and the speaker uses ``le
gerku poi blabi'' to refer to the brown dog, then the listener will not understand
correctly. However,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le gerku voi blabi cu klama
    the dog which-I-describe-as white goes
</pre>puts the listener on notice that the dog in question may not actually meet
objective standards (whatever they are) for being white: only the speaker can say exactly
what is meant by the term. In this way, ``voi'' is like ``le''; the speaker's intention
determines the meaning.

    <p>As a result, the following two sentences</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  le nanmu cu ninmu

something as a man (although perhaps confusing to the listener) even if it actually is a
woman.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s6" name="s6">6. Relative clauses and descriptors</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s6" name="s6">So far, this chapter has described the various kinds of
    relative clauses (including relative phrases). The list is now complete, and the rest
    of the chapter will be concerned with the syntax of sumti that include relative
    clauses. So far, all relative clauses have appeared directly after the sumti to which
    they are attached. This is the most common position (and originally the only one),
    but a variety of other placements are also possible which produce a variety of
    semantic effects.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s6" name="s6">There are actually three places where a relative clause can
    be attached to a description sumti: after the descriptor (``le'', ``lo'', or
    whatever), after the embedded selbri but before the elidable terminator (which is
    ``ku''), and after the ``ku''. The relative clauses attached to descriptors that we
    have seen have occupied the second position. Thus</a> <a href="#e5d1">Example
    5.1</a>, if written out with all elidable terminators, would appear as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  le gerku poi blabi ku'o ku cu klama vau
    the( dog which( is-white ) ) goes.
    The dog which is white is going.
</pre>Here ``ku'o'' is the terminator paired with ``poi'' and ``ku'' with ``le'', and
``vau'' is the terminator of the whole bridi.

    <p>When a simple descriptor using ``le'', like ``le gerku'', has a relative clause
    attached, it is purely a matter of style and emphasis where the relative clause
    should go. Therefore, the following examples are all equivalent in meaning to
    <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  le poi blabi ku'o gerku cu klama
    The such-that (it-is-white) dog goes.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>   le gerku ku poi blabi cu klama
    The( dog ) which is-white goes.
</pre><a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> will seem most natural to speakers of languages
like English, which always puts relative clauses after the noun phrases they are attached
to; <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a>, on the other hand, may seem more natural to Finnish
or Chinese speakers, who put the relative clause first. Note that in <a href=
"#e6d2">Example 6.2</a>, the elidable terminator ``ku'o'' must appear, or the selbri of
the relative clause (``blabi'') will merge with the selbri of the description
(``gerku''), resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. The purpose of the form appearing in
<a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> will be apparent shortly.

    <p>As is explained in detail in <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>, two different
    numbers (known as the ``inner quantifier'' and the ``outer quantifier'') can be
    attached to a description. The inner quantifier specifies how many things the
    descriptor refers to: it appears between the descriptor and the description selbri.
    The outer quantifier appears before the descriptor, and specifies how many of the
    things referred to by the descriptor are involved in this particular bridi. In the
    following example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  re le mu prenu cu klama le zarci

    Two of the five people [that I have in mind]
        are going to the market.
</pre>``mu'' is the inner quantifier and ``re'' is the outer quantifier. Now what is
meant by attaching a relative clause to the sumti ``re le mu prenu''? Suppose the
relative clause is ``poi ninmu'' (meaning ``who are women''). Now the three possible
attachment points discussed previously take on significance.

        go to-the market.
    Two of the five women go to the market.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  re le mu prenu ku poi ninmu
        cu klama le zarci
    (Two of the five persons ) which are-women
        go to-the market.
    Two women out of the five persons go to the market.
</pre>As the parentheses show, <a href="#e6d6">Example 6.6</a> means that all five of the
persons are women, whereas <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a> means that the two who are
going to the market are women. How do we remember which is which? If the relative clause
comes after the explicit ``ku'', as in <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a>, then the sumti as
a whole is qualified by the relative clause. If there is no ``ku'', or if the relative
clause comes before an explicit ``ku'', then the relative clause is understood to apply
to everything which the underlying selbri applies to.

    <p>What about <a href="#e6d5">Example 6.5</a>? By convention, it means the same as
    <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a>, and it requires no ``ku'', but it does typically
    require a ``ku'o'' instead. Note that the relative clause comes before the inner
    quantifier.</p>

    <p>When ``le'' is the descriptor being used, and the sumti has no explicit outer
    quantifier, then the outer quantifier is understood to be ``ro'' (meaning ``all''),
    as is explained in <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>. Thus ``le gerku'' is taken
    to mean ``all of the things I refer to as dogs'', possibly all one of them. In that
    case, there is no difference between a relative clause after the ``ku'' or before it.
    However, if the descriptor is ``lo'', the difference is quite important:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  lo prenu ku noi blabi
        cu klama le zarci
    (Some persons) incidentally-which are-white
        go to-the market.
    Some people, who are white, go to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>   lo prenu noi blabi [ku]
        cu klama le zarci
    Some (persons incidentally-which are-white)
        go to-the market.
    Some of the people, who by the way are white,
        go to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Both <a href="#e6d8">Examples 6.8</a> and <a href="#e6d9">6.9</a> tell us that one
    or more persons are going to the market. However, they make very different incidental
    claims. Now, what does ``lo prenu noi blabi'' mean? Well, the default inner
    quantifier is ``ro'' (meaning ``all''), and the default outer quantifier is ``su'o''
    (meaning ``at least one''). Therefore, we must first take all persons, then choose at
    least one of them. That one or more people will be going.</p>

    <p>In <a href="#e6d8">Example 6.8</a>, the relative clause described the sumti once
    the outer quantifier was applied: one or more people, who are white, are going. But
    in <a href="#e6d9">Example 6.9</a>, the relative clause actually describes the sumti
    before the outer quantification is applied, so that it ends up meaning ``First take
    all persons --- by the way, they're all white''. But not all people are white, so the
    incidental claim being made here is false.</p>

    <p>The safe strategy, therefore, is to always use ``ku'' when attaching a ``noi''
    relative clause to a ``lo'' descriptor. Otherwise we may end up claiming far too
    much.</p>

    <p>When the descriptor is ``la'', indicating that what follows is a selbri used for
    naming, then the positioning of relative clauses has a different significance. A
    relative clause inside the ``ku'', whether before or after the selbri, is reckoned
    part of the name; a relative clause outside the ``ku'' is not. Therefore,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d10" name="e6d10">6.10)</a>    mi viska la nanmu poi terpa le ke'a xirma [ku]
    I see that-named( ``man which fears the of-IT horse'' ).
    I see Man Afraid Of His Horse.
</pre>says that the speaker sees a person with a particular name, who does not
necessarily fear any horses, whereas
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d11" name="e6d11">6.11)</a>    mi viska la nanmu ku poi terpa le ke'a xirma.
    I see that-named( ``Man'' ) which fears the of-IT horse.
    I see the person named ``Man'' who is afraid of his horse.
</pre>refers to one (or more) of those named ``Man'', namely the one(s) who are afraid of
their horses.

    <p>Finally, so-called indefinite sumti like ``re karce'', which means almost the same
    as ``re lo karce'' (which in turn means the same as ``re lo ro karce''), can have
    relative clauses attached; these are taken to be of the outside-the-``ku'' variety.
    Here is an example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e6d12" name="e6d12">6.12)</a>    mi ponse re karce [ku] poi xekri
    I possess two cars which-are black.
</pre>The restrictive relative clause only affects the two cars being affected by the
main bridi, not all cars that exist. It is ungrammatical to try to place a relative
clause within an indefinite sumti (that is, before an explicitly expressed terminating
``ku''.) Use an explicit ``lo'' instead.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s7" name="s7">7. Possessive sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s7" name="s7">In</a> <a href="#e2d4">Examples 2.4</a> through <a href=
    "#e2d6">2.6</a>, the sumti ``le mi karce'' appears, glossed as ``my car''. Although
    it might not seem so, this sumti actually contains a relative phrase. When a sumti
    appears between a descriptor and its description selbri, it is actually a ``pe''
    relative phrase. So</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  le mi karce cu xunre
    my car is-red.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  le pe mi karce cu xunre
    the (associated-with me) car is-red.
</pre>mean exactly the same thing. Furthermore, since there are no special considerations
of quantifiers here,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  le karce pe mi cu xunre
    The car associated-with me is-red
</pre>means the same thing as well. A sumti like the one in <a href="#e7d1">Example
7.1</a> is called a ``possessive sumti''. Of course, it does not really indicate
possession in the sense of ownership, but like ``pe'' relative phrases, indicates only
weak association; you can say ``le mi karce'' even if you've only borrowed it for the
night. (In English, ``my car'' usually means ``le karce po mi'', but we do not have the
same sense of possession in ``my seat on the bus''; Lojban simply makes the weaker sense
the standard one.) The inner sumti, ``mi'' in <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>, is
correspondingly called the ``possessor sumti''.

    <p>Historically, possessive sumti existed before any other kind of relative phrase or
    clause, and were retained when the machinery of relative phrases and clauses as
    detailed in this chapter so far was slowly built up. When preposed relative clauses
    of the <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a> type were devised, possessive sumti were most
    easily viewed as a special case of them.</p>

    <p>Although any sumti, however complex, can appear in a full-fledged relative phrase,
    only simple sumti can appear as possessor sumti, without a ``pe''. Roughly speaking,
    the legal possessor sumti are: pro-sumti, quotations, names and descriptions, and
    numbers. In addition, the possessor sumti may not be preceded by a quantifier, as
    such a form would be interpreted as the unusual ``descriptor + quantifier + sumti''
    type of description. All these sumti forms are explained in full in <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a description used in a possessive sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  le le nanmu ku karce cu blanu
    The (associated-with-the man) car is blue.
    The man's car is blue.


Note the explicit ``ku'' at the end of the possessor sumti,
which prevents the selbri of the possessor sumti from merging
with the selbri of the main description sumti.  Because of the
need for this ``ku'', the most common kind of possessor sumti
are pro-sumti, especially personal pro-sumti, which require no
elidable terminator.  Descriptions are more likely to be attached
with relative phrases.
</pre>

    <p>And here is a number used as a possessor sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  le li mu jdice se bende
    The of-the-number-five judging team-member
    Juror number 5
</pre>which is not quite the same as ``the fifth juror''; it simply indicates a weak
association between the particular juror and the number 5.

    <p>A possessive sumti may also have regular relative clauses attached to it. This
    would need no comment if it were not for the following special rule: a relative
    clause immediately following the possessor sumti is understood to affect the
    possessor sumti, not the possessive. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  le mi noi sipna vau karce
        cu na klama
    The of-me incidentally-which( is-sleeping ) car
        isn't going.
</pre>means that my car isn't going; the incidental claim of ``noi sipna'' applies to me,
not my car, however. If I wanted to say that the car is sleeping (whatever that might
mean) I would need:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  le mi karce poi sipna cu na klama
    The of-me car which sleeps isn't going.
</pre>Note that <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a> uses ``vau'' rather than ``ku'o'' at the
end of the relative clause: this terminator ends every simple bridi and is almost always
elidable; in this case, though, it is a syllable shorter than the equally valid
alternative, ``ku'o''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s8" name="s8">8. Relative clauses and complex sumti: ``vu'o''</a></h2>

    ``I'm going to the market'', which I'd said, is a sentence.
</pre>which may serve to identify the author of the quotation or some other relevant, but
subsidiary, fact about it. All such relative clauses appear only after the simple sumti,
never before it.

    <p>In addition, sumti with attached sumti qualifiers of selma'o LAhE or NAhE+BO
    (which are explained in detail in <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>) can have a
    relative clause appearing after the qualifier and before the qualified sumti, as
    in:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  la'e poi tolcitno vau

        [quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote]
        is-at the [far distance] room.
    An old ``The Red Pony'' is in the far room.
</pre><a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> is a bit complex, and may need some picking apart.
The quotation ``lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u'' means the string of words ``The Red Pony''.
If the ``la'e'' at the beginning of the sentence were omitted, <a href="#e8d3">Example
8.3</a> would claim that a certain string of words is in a room distant from the speaker.
But obviously a string of words can't be in a room! The effect of the ``la'e'' is to
modify the sumti so that it refers not to the words themselves, but to the referent of
those words, a novel by John Steinbeck (presumably in Lojban translation). The particular
copy of ``The Red Pony'' is identified by the restrictive relative clause. <a href=
"#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> means exactly the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  la'e lu le xunre cmaxirma li'u lu'u
        poi to'ercitno cu zvati le vu kumfa
    A-referent-of ([quote] The Red Small-horse [unquote])
        which is-old is-at the [far distance] room.
</pre>and the two sentences can be considered stylistic variants. Note the required
``lu'u'' terminator, which prevents the relative clause from attaching to the quotation
itself: we do not wish to refer to an old quotation!

    <p>Sometimes, however, it is important to make a relative clause apply to the whole
    of a more complex sumti, one which involves logical or non-logical connection
    (explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>). For example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. noi nanmu
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and George incidentally-who is-a-man
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who is a man, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>The incidental claim in <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> is not that Frank and
    George are men, but only that George is a man, because the incidental relative clause
    attaches only to ``la djordj'', the immediately preceding simple sumti.</p>

    <p>To make a relative clause attach to both parts of the logically connected sumti in
    <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a>, a new cmavo is needed, ``vu'o'' (of selma'o VUhO).
    It is placed between the sumti and the relative clause, and extends the sphere of
    influence of that relative clause to the entire preceding sumti, including however
    many logical or non-logical connectives there may be.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. vu'o noi nanmu
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and George incidentally-who are-men
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who are men, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>The presence of ``vu'o'' here means that the relative clause ``noi nanmu'' extends
    to the entire logically connected sumti ``la frank. .e la djordj.''; in other words,
    both Frank and George are claimed to be men, as the colloquial translation shows.</p>

    <p>English is able to resolve the distinction correctly in the case of <a href=
    "#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> and <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a> by making use of number:
    ``who is'' rather than ``who are''. Lojban doesn't distinguish between singular and
    plural verbs: ``nanmu'' can mean ``is a man'' or ``are men'', so another means is
    required. Furthermore, Lojban's mechanism works correctly in general: if ``nanmu''
    (meaning ``is-a-man'') were replaced with ``pu bajra'' (``ran''), English would have
    to make the distinction some other way:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  la frank. .e la djordj. noi pu bajra
        cu klama le zdani
    Frank and (George who [past] runs)

    (Frank and George) who [past] runs
        go to-the house.
    Frank and George, who ran, go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>In spoken English, tone of voice would serve; in written English, one or both
    sentences would need rewriting.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s9" name="s9">9. Relative clauses in vocative phrases</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s9" name="s9">Vocative phrases are explained in more detail in</a> <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>. Briefly, they are a method of indicating who a
    sentence or discourse is addressed to: of identifying the intended listener. They
    take three general forms, all beginning with cmavo from selma'o COI or DOI (called
    ``vocative words''; there can be one or many), followed by either a name, a selbri,
    or a sumti. Here are three examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  coi. frank.
    Hello, Frank.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>   co'o xirma
    Goodbye, horse.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>   fi'i la frank. .e la djordj.
    Welcome, Frank and George!
</pre>

    <p>Note that <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> says farewell to something which doesn't
    really have to be a horse, something that the speaker simply thinks of as being a
    horse, or even might be something (a person, for example) who is named ``Horse''. In
    a sense, <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> is ambiguous between ``co'o le xirma'' and
    ``co'o la xirma'', a relatively safe semantic ambiguity, since names are ambiguous in
    general: saying ``George'' doesn't distinguish between the possible Georges.</p>

    <p>Similarly, <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> can be thought of as an abbreviation
    of:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  coi la frank.
    Hello, the-one-named ``Frank''.
</pre>

    <p>Syntactically, vocative phrases are a kind of free modifier, and can appear in
    many places in Lojban text, generally at the beginning or end of some complete
    construct; or, as in <a href="#e9d1">Examples 9.1</a> to <a href="#e9d3">9.3</a>, as
    sentences by themselves.</p>

    <p>As can be seen, the form of vocative phrases is similar to that of sumti, and as
    you might expect, vocative phrases allow relative clauses in various places. In
    vocative phrases which are simple names (after the vocative words), any relative
    clauses must come just after the names:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  coi. frank. poi xunre se bende
    Hello, Frank who is-a-red team-member
    Hello, Frank from the Red Team!
</pre>

    <p>The restrictive relative clause in <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> suggests that
    there is some other Frank (perhaps on the Green Team) from whom this Frank, the one
    the speaker is greeting, must be distinguished.</p>

    <p>A vocative phrase containing a selbri can have relative clauses either before or
    after the selbri; both forms have the same meaning. Here are some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  co'o poi mi zvati ke'a ku'o xirma
    Goodbye, such-that( I am-at IT ) horse
    Goodbye, horse where I am!

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>   co'o xirma poi mi zvati
    Goodbye, horse such-that( I am-at-it).
</pre><a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a> and <a href="#e9d7">Example 9.7</a> mean the same
thing. In fact, relative clauses can appear in both places.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s10" name="s10">10. Relative clauses within relative clauses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-s10" name="s10">For the most part, these are straightforward and

</pre>However, an ambiguity can exist if ``ke'a'' is used in a relative clause within a
relative clause: does it refer to the outermost sumti, or to the sumti within the outer
relative clause to which the inner relative clause is attached? The latter. To refer to
the former, use a subscript on ``ke'a'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-8-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    le prenu poi zvati le kumfa

    The person who is in the room which he built is slow.
</pre>Here, the meaning of ``IT-sub-2'' is that sumti attached to the second relative
clause, counting from the innermost, is used. Therefore, ``ke'axipa'' (IT-sub-1) means
the same as plain ``ke'a''.

    <p>Alternatively, you can use a prenex (explained in full in <a href=
    "chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>), which is syntactically a series of sumti followed
    by the special cmavo ``zo'u'', prefixed to the relative clause bridi:</p>

</pre><a href="#e10d3">Example 10.3</a> is more verbose than <a href="#e10d2">Example
10.2</a>, but may be clearer, since it explicitly spells out the two ``ke'a'' cmavo, each
on its own level, and assigns them to the assignable cmavo ``ko'a'' and ``ko'e''
(explained in Chapter ).

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s1" name="s1">The basic type of Lojban sentence is the bridi: a claim by
    the speaker that certain objects are related in a certain way. The objects are
    expressed by Lojban grammatical forms called ``sumti''; the relationship is expressed
    by the Lojban grammatical form called a ``selbri''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s1" name="s1">The sumti are not randomly associated with the selbri, but
    according to a systematic pattern known as the ``place structure'' of the selbri.
    This chapter describes the various ways in which the place structure of Lojban bridi
    is expressed and by which it can be manipulated. The place structure of a selbri is a
    sequence of empty slots into which the sumti associated with that selbri are placed.
    The sumti are said to occupy the places of a selbri.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s1" name="s1">For our present purposes, every selbri is assumed to have a
    well-known place structure. If the selbri is a brivla, the place structure can be
    looked up in a dictionary (or, if the brivla is a lujvo not in any dictionary,
    inferred from the principles of lujvo construction as explained in</a> <a href=
    "chapter12.html">Chapter 12</a>); if the selbri is a tanru, the place structure is
    the same as that of the final component in the tanru.</p>

    <p>The stock example of a place structure is that of the gismu ``klama'':</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 comes/goes to destination x2 from origin x3 via route x4 employing means of
      transport x5.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The ``x1 ... x5'' indicates that ``klama'' is a five-place predicate, and show the
    natural order (as assigned by the language engineers) of those places: agent,
    destination, origin, route, means.</p>

    <p>The place structures of brivla are not absolutely stable aspects of the language.
    The work done so far has attempted to establish a basic place structure on which all
    users can, at first, agree. In the light of actual experience with the individual
    selbri of the language, there will inevitably be some degree of change to the brivla
    place structures.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s2" name="s2">2. Standard bridi form: ``cu''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s2" name="s2">   cu  CU  prefixed selbri separator
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s2" name="s2">The most usual way of constructing a bridi from a selbri such
as ``klama'' and an appropriate number of sumti is to place the sumti intended for the x1
place before the selbri, and all the other sumti in order after the selbri, thus:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  mi cu klama la bastn. la .atlantas.
        le dargu le karce
    I go to-Boston from-Atlanta
        via-the road using-the car.
</pre>

    <p>Here the sumti are assigned to the places as follows:</p>
    <pre>
   x1  agent       mi
    x2  destination la bastn.
    x3  origin      la .atlantas.
    x4  route       le dargu
    x5  means       le karce
</pre>(Note: Many of the examples in the rest of this chapter will turn out to have the
same meaning as <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>; this fact will not be reiterated.)

    <p>This ordering, with the x1 place before the selbri and all other places in natural
    order after the selbri, is called ``standard bridi form'', and is found in the bulk
    of Lojban bridi, whether used in main sentences or in subordinate clauses. However,
    many other forms are possible, such as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  mi la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu
        le karce cu klama
    I, to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road
        using-the car, go.
</pre>Here the selbri is at the end; all the sumti are placed before it. However, the
same order is maintained.

    <p>Similarly, we may split up the sumti, putting some before the selbri and others
    after it:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  mi la bastn. cu klama la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
    I to-Boston go from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
</pre>All of the variant forms in this section and following sections can be used to
place emphasis on the part or parts which have been moved out of their standard places.
Thus, <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a> places emphasis on the selbri (because it is at the
end); <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> emphasizes ``la bastn.'', because it has been moved
before the selbri. Moving more than one component may dilute this emphasis. It is
permitted, but no stylistic significance has yet been established for drastic reordering.

    <p>In all these examples, the cmavo ``cu'' (belonging to selma'o CU) is used to
    separate the selbri from any preceding sumti. It is never absolutely necessary to use
    ``cu''. However, providing it helps the reader or listener to locate the selbri
    quickly, and may make it possible to place a complex sumti just before the selbri,
    allowing the speaker to omit elidable terminators, possibly a whole stream of them,
    that would otherwise be necessary.</p>

    <p>The general rule, then, is that the selbri may occur anywhere in the bridi as long
    as the sumti maintain their order. The only exception (and it is an important one) is
    that if the selbri appears first, the x1 sumti is taken to have been omitted:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  klama la bastn. la .atlantas. le dargu le karce
    A-goer to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
    Goes to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the road using-the car.
    Look: a goer to Boston from Atlanta via the road
        using the car!
</pre>Here the x1 place is empty: the listener must guess from context who is going to
Boston. In <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a>, ``klama'' is glossed ``a goer'' rather than
``go'' because ``Go'' at the beginning of an English sentence would suggest a command:
``Go to Boston!''. <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> is not a command, simply a normal
statement with the x1 place unspecified, causing the emphasis to fall on the selbri
``klama''. Such a bridi, with empty x1, is called an ``observative'', because it usually
calls on the listener to observe something in the environment which would belong in the
x1 place. The third translation above shows this observative nature. Sometimes it is the
relationship itself which the listener is asked to observe.

    <p>(There is a way to both provide a sumti for the x1 place and put the selbri first
    in the bridi: see <a href="#e3d7">Example 3.7</a>.)</p>

    <p>Suppose the speaker desires to omit a place other than the x1 place? (Presumably
    it is obvious or, for one reason or another, not worth saying.) Places at the end may
    simply be dropped:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  mi klama la bastn. la .atlantas.
    I go to-Boston from-Atlanta (via an unspecified route,
    using an unspecified means).
</pre><a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> has empty x4 and x5 places: the speaker does not
specify the route or the means of transport. However, simple omission will not work for a
place when the places around it are to be specified: in
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  mi klama la bastn. la .atlantas. le karce
    I go to-Boston from-Atlanta via-the car.
</pre>``le karce'' occupies the x4 place, and therefore <a href="#e2d6">Example 2.6</a>
means:

    <dl>
      <dd>I go to Boston from Atlanta, using the car as a route.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This is nonsense, since a car cannot be a route. What the speaker presumably meant
    is expressed by:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  mi klama la bastn. la .atlantas.
        zo'e le karce
    I go to-Boston from-Atlanta
        via-something-unspecified using-the car.
</pre>Here the sumti cmavo ``zo'e'' is used to explicitly fill the x4 place; ``zo'e''
means ``the unspecified thing'' and has the same meaning as leaving the place empty: the
listener must infer the correct meaning from context.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s3" name="s3">3. Tagging places: FA</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s3" name="s3">   fa  FA  tags x1 place
    fe  FA  tags x2 place
    fi  FA  tags x3 place
    fo  FA  tags x4 place
    fu  FA  tags x5 place
    fi'a    FA  place structure question
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s3" name="s3">In sentences like</a> <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>, it is
easy to get lost and forget which sumti falls in which place, especially if the sumti are
more complicated than simple names or descriptions. The place structure tags of selma'o
FA may be used to help clarify place structures. The five cmavo ``fa'', ``fe'', ``fi'',
``fo'', and ``fu'' may be inserted just before the sumti in the x1 to x5 places
respectively:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  fa mi cu klama fe la bastn.
        fi la .atlantas. fo le dargu fu le karce
    x1= I go x2= Boston
        x3= Atlanta x4= the road x5= the car.
    I go to Boston from Atlanta via the road using the car.
</pre>In <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a>, the tag ``fu'' before ``le karce'' clarifies
that ``le karce'' occupies the x5 place of ``klama''. The use of ``fu'' tells us nothing
about the purpose or meaning of the x5 place; it simply says that ``le karce'' occupies
it.

    <p>In <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a>, the tags are overkill; they serve only to make
    <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a> even longer than it is. Here is a better illustration
    of the use of FA tags for clarification:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  fa mi klama fe le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau
        fi la nu,IORK.
    x1= I go x2= (the house of me) which is-rural
        x3= New York.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>, the place structure of ``klama'' is as
    follows:</p>
    <pre>
   x1  agent       mi
    x2  destination le zdani be mi be'o poi nurma vau
    x3  origin      la nu,IORK.
    x4  route       (empty)
    x5  means       (empty)
</pre>The ``fi'' tag serves to remind the hearer that what follows is in the x3 place of
``klama''; after listening to the complex sumti occupying the x2 place, it's easy to get
lost.

    <p>Of course, once the sumti have been tagged, the order in which they are specified
    no longer carries the burden of distinguishing the places. Therefore, it is perfectly
    all right to scramble them into any order desired, and to move the selbri to anywhere
    in the bridi, even the beginning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  klama fa mi fi la .atlantas.
        fu le karce fe la bastn. fo le dargu
    go x1= I x3= Atlanta
        x5= the car x2= Boston x4= the road.
    Go I from Atlanta using the car to Boston via the road.
</pre>Note that no ``cu'' is permitted before the selbri in <a href="#e3d3">Example
3.3</a>, because ``cu'' separates the selbri from any preceding sumti, and <a href=
"#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> has no such sumti.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  fu le karce fo le dargu fi la .atlantas.
        fe la bastn. cu klama fa mi
    x5= the car x4= the road x3= Atlanta
        x2= Boston go x1=I
    Using the car, via the road, from Atlanta to Boston
        go I.
</pre><a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> exhibits the reverse of the standard bridi form
seen in <a href="#e2d1">Examples 2.1</a> and <a href="#e3d1">3.1</a>, but still means
exactly the same thing. If the FA tags were left out, however, producing:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  le karce le dargu la .atlantas.
        la bastn. cu klama mi
    The car to-the road from-Atlanta
        via-Boston goes using-me.
    The car goes to the road from Atlanta, with Boston
        as the route, using me as a means
        of transport.
</pre>the meaning would be wholly changed, and in fact nonsensical.

    <p>Tagging places with FA cmavo makes it easy not only to reorder the places but also
    to omit undesirable ones, without any need for ``zo'e'' or special rules about the x1
    place:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  klama fi la .atlantas. fe la bastn. fu le karce
    A-goer x3= Atlanta x2= Boston x5 = the car.
    A goer from Atlanta to Boston using the car.
</pre>

    <p>Here the x1 and x4 places are empty, and so no sumti are tagged with ``fa'' or
    ``fo''; in addition, the x2 and x3 places appear in reverse order.</p>

    <p>What if some sumti have FA tags and others do not? The rule is that after a
    FA-tagged sumti, any sumti following it occupy the places numerically succeeding it,
    subject to the proviso that an already-filled place is skipped:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  klama fa mi la bastn. la .atlantas.
        le dargu le karce
    Go x1= I x2= Boston x3= Atlanta
        x4= the road x5= the car.
    Go I to Boston from Atlanta via the road
        using the car.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d7">Example 3.7</a>, the ``fa'' causes ``mi'' to occupy the x1
    place, and then the following untagged sumti occupy in order the x2 through x5
    places. This is the mechanism by which Lojban allows placing the selbri first while
    specifying a sumti for the x1 place.</p>

    <p>Here is a more complex (and more confusing) example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>  mi klama fi la .atlantas. le dargu
        fe la bastn. le karce
    I go x3= Atlanta the road
        x2= Boston the car.
    I go from Atlanta via the road to Boston using the car.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d8">Example 3.8</a>, ``mi'' occupies the x1 place because it is the
    first sumti in the sentence (and is before the selbri). The second sumti, ``la
    .atlantas.'', occupies the x3 place by virtue of the tag ``fi'', and ``le dargu''
    occupies the x4 place as a result of following ``la .atlantas.''. Finally, ``la
    bastn.'' occupies the x2 place because of its tag ``fe'', and ``le karce'' skips over
    the already-occupied x3 and x4 places to land in the x5 place.</p>

    <p>Such a convoluted use of tags should probably be avoided except when trying for a
    literal translation of some English (or other natural-language) sentence; the rules
    stated here are merely given so that some standard interpretation is possible.</p>

    <p>It is grammatically permitted to tag more than one sumti with the same FA cmavo.
    The effect is that of making more than one claim:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  [fa] la rik. fa la djein. klama
        [fe] le skina fe le zdani fe le zarci
    [x1=] Rick x1= Jane goes-to
        x2= the movie x2= the house x2= the office
</pre>may be taken to say that both Rick and Jane go to the movie, the house, and the
office, merging six claims into one. More likely, however, it will simply confuse the
listener. There are better ways, involving logical connectives (explained in <a href=
"chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>), to say such things in Lojban. In fact, putting more
than one sumti into a place is odd enough that it can only be done by explicit FA usage:
this is the motivation for the proviso above, that already-occupied places are skipped.
In this way, no sumti can be forced into a place already occupied unless it has an
explicit FA cmavo tagging it.

    <p>The cmavo ``fi'a'' also belongs to selma'o FA, and allows Lojban users to ask
    questions about place structures. A bridi containing ``fi'a'' is a question, asking
    the listener to supply the appropriate other member of FA which will make the bridi a
    true statement:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e3d10" name="e3d10">3.10)</a>    fi'a do dunda [fe] le vi rozgu
    [what place]? you give x2= the nearby rose
    In what way are you involved in the giving of this rose?
    Are you the giver or the receiver of this rose?
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e3d10">Example 3.10</a>, the speaker uses the selbri ``dunda'', whose
    place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 gives x2 to x3</dd>
    </dl>The tagged sumti ``fi'a do'' indicates that the speaker wishes to know whether
    the sumti ``do'' falls in the x1 or the x3 place (the x2 place is already occupied by
    ``le rozgu''). The listener can reply with a sentence consisting solely of a FA
    cmavo: ``fa'' if the listener is the giver, ``fi'' if he/she is the receiver.

    <p>I have inserted the tag ``fe'' in brackets into <a href="#e3d10">Example 3.10</a>,
    but it is actually not necessary, because ``fi'a'' does not count as a numeric tag;
    therefore, ``le vi rozgu'' would necessarily be in the x2 place even if no tag were
    present, because it immediately follows the selbri.</p>

    <p>There is also another member of FA, namely ``fai'', which is discussed in <a href=
    "#s12">Section 12</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s4" name="s4">4. Conversion: SE</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s4" name="s4">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s4" name="s4">   se  SE  2nd place conversion

    ve  SE  4th place conversion

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s4" name="s4">So far we have seen ways to move sumti around within a bridi,
but the actual place structure of the selbri has always remained untouched. The
conversion cmavo of selma'o SE are incorporated within the selbri itself, and produce a
new selbri (called a converted selbri) with a different place structure. In particular,
after the application of any SE cmavo, the number and purposes of the places remain the
same, but two of them have been exchanged, the x1 place and another. Which place has been
exchanged with x1 depends on the cmavo chosen. Thus, for example, when ``se'' is used,
the x1 place is swapped with the x2 place.</a>

    <p>Note that the cmavo of SE begin with consecutive consonants in alphabetical order.
    There is no ``1st place conversion'' cmavo, because exchanging the x1 place with
    itself is a pointless maneuver.</p>

    <p>Here are the place structures of ``se klama'':</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the destination of x2's going from x3 via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>and ``te klama'':

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the origin and x2 the destination of x3 going via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>and ``ve klama'':

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the route to x2 from x3 used by x4 going via x5</dd>
    </dl>and ``xe klama'':

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the means in going to x2 from x3 via x4 employed by x5</dd>
    </dl>Note that the place structure numbers in each case continue to be listed in the
    usual order, x1 to x5.

    <p>Consider the following pair of examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  la bastn. cu se klama mi
    Boston is-the-destination of-me.

    Boston is gone to by me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>   fe la bastn. cu klama fa mi
    x2 = Boston go x1=I.
    To Boston go I.
</pre><a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a> and <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> mean the same
thing, in the sense that there is a relationship of going with the speaker as the agent
and Boston as the destination (and with unspecified origin, route, and means).
Structurally, however, they are quite different. <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a> has ``la
bastn.'' in the x1 place and ``mi'' in the x2 place of the selbri ``se klama'', and uses
standard bridi order; <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> has ``mi'' in the x1 place and ``la
bastn.'' in the x2 place of the selbri ``klama'', and uses a non-standard order.

    <p>The most important use of conversion is in the construction of descriptions. A
    description is a sumti which begins with a cmavo of selma'o LA or LE, called the
    descriptor, and contains (in the simplest case) a selbri. We have already seen the
    descriptions ``le dargu'' and ``le karce''. To this we could add:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  le klama
    the go-er, the one who goes
</pre>In every case, the description is about something which fits into the x1 place of
the selbri. In order to get a description of a destination (that is, something fitting
the x2 place of ``klama''), we must convert the selbri to ``se klama'', whose x1 place is
a destination. The result is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  le se klama
    the destination gone to by someone
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, we can create three more converted descriptions:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  le te klama
    the origin of someone's going

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>   le ve klama
    the route of someone's going

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>   le xe klama
    the means by which someone goes
</pre><a href="#e4d6">Example 4.6</a> does not mean ``the route'' plain and simple: that
is ``le pluta'', using a different selbri. It means a route that is used by someone for
an act of ``klama''; that is, a journey with origin and destination. A ``road'' on Mars,
on which no one has traveled or is ever likely to, may be called ``le pluta'', but it
cannot be ``le ve klama'', since there exists no one for whom it is ``le ve klama be fo
da'' (the route taken in an actual journey by someone [da]).

    <p>When converting selbri that are more complex than a single brivla, it is important
    to realize that the scope of a SE cmavo is only the following brivla (or equivalent
    unit). In order to convert an entire tanru, it is necessary to enclose the tanru in
    ``ke ... ke'e'' brackets:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e4d8" name="e4d8">4.8)</a>  mi se ke blanu zdani [ke'e] ti
    I [2nd conversion] blue house this-thing
</pre>

    <p>The place structure of ``blanu zdani'' (blue house) is the same as that of
    ``zdani'', by the rule given in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>. The place structure of
    ``zdani'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is a house/nest/lair/den for inhabitant x2</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The place structure of ``se ke blanu zdani [ke'e]'' is therefore:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the inhabitant of the blue house (etc.) x2</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Consequently, <a href="#e4d8">Example 4.8</a> means:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>I am the inhabitant of the blue house which is this thing.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Conversion applied to only part of a tanru has subtler effects which are explained
    in <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

    <p>It is grammatical to convert a selbri more than once with SE; later (inner)
    conversions are applied before earlier (outer) ones. For example, the place structure
    of ``se te klama'' is achieved by exchanging the x1 and x2 place of ``te klama'',
    producing:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the destination and x2 is the origin of x3 going via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>On the other hand, ``te se klama'' has a place structure derived from swapping the
    x1 and x3 places of ``se klama'':</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the origin of x2's going to x3 via x4 using x5</dd>
    </dl>which is quite different. However, multiple conversions like this are never
    necessary. Arbitrary scrambling of places can be achieved more easily and far more
    intelligibly with FA tags, and only a single conversion is ever needed in a
    description.

    <p>(Although no one has made any real use of it, it is perhaps worth noting that
    compound conversions of the form ``setese'', where the first and third cmavo are the
    same, effectively swap the two given places while leaving the others, including x1,
    alone: ``setese'' (or equivalently ``tesete'') swap the x2 and x3 places, whereas
    ``texete'' (or ``xetexe'') swap the x3 and x5 places.)</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">   fi'o    FIhO    modal place prefix
    fe'u    FEhU    modal terminator
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">Sometimes the place structures engineered into Lojban are
    inadequate to meet the needs of actual speech. Consider the gismu ``viska'', whose
    place structure is:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5"></a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">x1 sees x2 under conditions x3</a></dd>
    </dl>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">Seeing is a threefold relationship, involving an agent (le
    viska), an object of sight (le se viska), and an environment that makes seeing
    possible (le te viska). Seeing is done with one or more eyes, of course; in general,
    the eyes belong to the entity in the x1 place.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5">Suppose, however, that you are blind in one eye and are
    talking to someone who doesn't know that. You might want to say, ``I see you with the
    left eye.'' There is no place in the place structure of ``viska'' such as ``with eye
    x4'' or the like. Lojban allows you to solve the problem by adding a new place,
    changing the relationship:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s5" name="s5"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e5d1" name=
"e5d1">5.1)</a>  mi viska do fi'o kanla [fe'u] le zunle
    I see you [modal] eye: the left-thing
    I see you with the left eye.
</pre>The three-place relation ``viska'' has now acquired a fourth place specifying the
eye used for seeing. The combination of the cmavo ``fi'o'' (of selma'o FIhO) followed by
a selbri, in this case the gismu ``kanla'', forms a tag which is prefixed to the sumti
filling the new place, namely ``le zunle''. The semantics of ``fi'o kanla le zunle'' is
that ``le zunle'' fills the x1 place of ``kanla'', whose place structure is

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is an/the eye of body x2</dd>
    </dl>Thus ``le zunle'' is an eye. The x2 place of ``kanla'' is unspecified and must
    be inferred from the context. It is important to remember that even though ``le
    zunle'' is placed following ``fi'o kanla'', semantically it belongs in the x1 place
    of ``kanla''. The selbri may be terminated with ``fe'u'' (of selma'o FEhU), an
    elidable terminator which is rarely required unless a non-logical connective follows
    the tag (omitting ``fe'u'' in that case would make the connective affect the selbri).

    <p>The term for such an added place is a ``modal place'', as distinguished from the
    regular numbered places. (This use of the word ``modal'' is specific to the Loglan
    Project, and does not agree with the standard uses in either logic or linguistics,
    but is now too entrenched to change easily.) The ``fi'o'' construction marking a
    modal place is called a ``modal tag'', and the sumti which follows it a ``modal
    sumti''; the purely Lojban terms ``sumti tcita'' and ``seltcita sumti'',
    respectively, are also commonly used. Modal sumti may be placed anywhere within the
    bridi, in any order; they have no effect whatever on the rules for assigning unmarked
    bridi to numbered places, and they may not be marked with FA cmavo.</p>

    <p>Consider <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> again. Another way to view the situation
    is to consider the speaker's left eye as a tool, a tool for seeing. The relevant
    selbri then becomes ``pilno'', whose place structure is</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 uses x2 as a tool for purpose x3</dd>
    </dl>and we can rewrite <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a> as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  mi viska do fi'o se pilno le zunle kanla
    I see you [modal] [conversion] use: the left eye
    I see you using my left eye.
</pre>

    <p>Here the selbri belonging to the modal is ``se pilno''. The conversion of
    ``pilno'' is necessary in order to get the ``tool'' place into x1, since only x1 can
    be the modal sumti. The ``tool user'' place is the x2 of ``se pilno'' (because it is
    the x1 of ``pilno'') and remains unspecified. The tag ``fi'o pilno'' would mean
    ``with tool user'', leaving the tool unspecified.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s6" name="s6">6. Modal tags: BAI</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s6" name="s6">There are certain selbri which seem particularly useful in
    constructing modal tags. In particular, ``pilno'' is one of them. The place structure
    of ``pilno'' is:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s6" name="s6"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s6" name="s6">x1 uses tool x2</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s6" name="s6">and almost any selbri which represents an action may need
    to specify a tool. Having to say ``fi'o se pilno'' frequently would make many Lojban
    sentences unnecessarily verbose and clunky, so an abbreviation is provided in the
    language design: the compound cmavo ``sepi'o''.</a>

    <p>Here ``se'' is used before a cmavo, namely ``pi'o'', rather than before a brivla.
    The meaning of this cmavo, which belongs to selma'o BAI, is exactly the same as that
    of ``fi'o pilno fe'u''. Since what we want is a tag based on ``se pilno'' rather than
    ``pilno'' --- the tool, not the tool user --- the grammar allows a BAI cmavo to be
    converted using a SE cmavo. <a href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> may therefore be
    rewritten as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  mi viska do sepi'o le zunle kanla
    I see you with-tool: the left eye
    I see you using my left eye.
</pre>

    <p>The compound cmavo ``sepi'o'' is much shorter than ``fi'o se pilno [fe'u]'' and
    can be thought of as a single word meaning ``with-tool''. The modal tag ``pi'o'',
    with no ``se'', similarly means ``with-tool-user'', probably a less useful concept.
    Nevertheless, the parallelism with the place structure of ``pilno'' makes the
    additional syllable worthwhile.</p>

    <p>Some BAI cmavo make sense with as well as without a SE cmavo; for example,
    ``ka'a'', the BAI corresponding to the gismu ``klama'', has five usable forms
    corresponding to the five places of ``klama'' respectively:</p>
    <pre>
   ka'a        with-goer
    seka'a      with-destination
    teka'a      with-origin
    veka'a      with-route
    xeka'a      with-means-of-transport
</pre>

    <p>Any of these tags may be used to provide modal places for bridi, as in the
    following examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la .eivn. cu vecnu loi flira cinta ka'a mi

    I am a traveling cosmetics salesperson for Avon.
</pre>(<a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> may seem a bit strained, but it illustrates the
way in which an existing selbri, ``vecnu'' in this case, may have a place added to it
which might otherwise seem utterly unrelated.)

    I eat with-means-of-transport the airplane.
    I eat in the airplane.
</pre>There are sixty-odd cmavo of selma'o BAI, based on selected gismu that seemed
useful in a variety of settings. The list is somewhat biased toward English, because many
of the cmavo were selected on the basis of corresponding English prepositions and
preposition compounds such as ``with'', ``without'', and ``by means of''. The BAI cmavo,
however, are far more precise than English prepositions, because their meanings are fixed
by the place structures of the corresponding gismu.

    <p>All BAI cmavo have the form CV'V or CVV. Most of them are CV'V, where the C is the
    first consonant of the corresponding gismu and the two Vs are the two vowels of the
    gismu. The table in <a href="#s16">Section 16</a> shows the exceptions.</p>

    <p>There is one additional BAI cmavo that is not derived from a gismu: ``do'e''. This
    cmavo is used when an extra place is needed, but it seems useful to be vague about
    the semantic implications of the extra place:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  lo nanmu be do'e le berti cu klama le tcadu
    Some man [related to] the north came to-the city.
    A man of the north came to the city.
</pre>Here ``le berti'' is provided as a modal place of the selbri ``nanmu'', but its
exact significance is vague, and is paralleled in the colloquial translation by the vague
English preposition ``of''. <a href="#e6d7">Example 6.7</a> also illustrates a modal
place bound into a selbri with ``be''. This construction is useful when the selbri of a
description requires a modal place; this and other uses of ``be'' are more fully
explained in <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.

</pre>In <a href="#e7d1">Examples 7.1</a> through <a href="#e7d4">7.4</a>, the same
English word ``because'' is used to translate all four modals, but the types of cause
being expressed are quite different. Let us now focus on <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>,
and explore some variations on it.

    <p>As written, <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> claims that the plant grows, but only
    refers to the event of watering it in an abstraction bridi (abstractions are
    explained in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>) without actually making a
    claim. If I express <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a>, I have said that the plant in
    fact grows, but I have not said that you actually water it, merely that there is a
    causal relationship between watering and growing. This is semantically asymmetrical.
    Suppose I wanted to claim that the plant was being watered, and only mention its
    growth as ancillary information? Then we could reverse the main bridi and the
    abstraction bridi, saying:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  do djacu dunda fi le spati
        seri'a le nu ri banro
    You water-give to the plant
        with-physical-effect it grows.
    You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre>with the ``ri'a'' changed to ``seri'a''. In addition, there are also symmetrical
forms:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  le nu do djacu dunda fi le spati cu rinka
        le nu le spati cu banro
    The event-of (you water-give to the plant) causes
        the event-of (the plant grows).
    Your watering the plant causes its growth.
    If you water the plant, then it grows.
</pre>does not claim either event, but asserts only the causal relationship between them.
So in <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a>, I am not saying that the plant grows nor that you
have in fact watered it. The second colloquial translation shows a form of ``if-then'' in
English quite distinct from the logical connective ``if-then'' explained in <a href=
"chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>.

    <p>Suppose we wish to claim both events as well as their causal relationship? We can
    use one of two methods:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  le spati cu banro .iri'abo do djacu dunda fi le spati
    The plant grows.  Because you water-give to the plant.
    The plant grows because you water it.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>   do djacu dunda fi le spati
        .iseri'abo le spati cu banro
    You water-give to the plant.
        Therefore it grows.
    You water the plant; therefore, it grows.
</pre>

    <p>The compound cmavo ``.iri'abo'' and ``.iseri'abo'' serve to connect two bridi, as
    the initial ``.i'' indicates. The final ``bo'' is necessary to prevent the modal from
    ``taking over'' the following sumti. If the ``bo'' were omitted from <a href=
    "#e7d7">Example 7.7</a> we would have:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e7d9" name="e7d9">7.9)</a>  le spati cu banro
        .i ri'a do djacu dunda
            fi le spati
    The plant grows.
        Because of you, [something] water-gives
            to the plant.
    The plant grows.  Because of you, water is given
        to the plant.
</pre>

    <p>Because ``ri'a do'' is a modal sumti in <a href="#e7d9">Example 7.9</a>, there is
    no longer an explicit sumti in the x1 place of ``djacu dunda'', and the translation
    must be changed.</p>

    <p>The effect of sentences like <a href="#e7d7">Example 7.7</a> and <a href=
    "#e7d8">Example 7.8</a> is that the modal, ``ri'a'' in this example, no longer
    modifies an explicit sumti. Instead, the sumti is implicit, the event given by a full
    bridi. Furthermore, there is a second implication: that the first bridi fills the x2
    place of the gismu ``rinka''; it specifies an event which is the effect. I am
    therefore claiming three things: that the plant grows, that you have watered it, and
    that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two.</p>

    <p>In principle, any modal tag can appear in a sentence connective of the type
    exemplified by <a href="#e7d7">Example 7.7</a> and <a href="#e7d8">Example 7.8</a>.
    However, it makes little sense to use any modals which do not expect events or other
    abstractions to fill the places of the corresponding gismu. The sentence connective
    ``.ibaubo'' is perfectly grammatical, but it is hard to imagine any two sentences
    which could be connected by an ``in-language'' modal. This is because a sentence
    describes an event, and an event can be a cause or an effect, but not a language.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s8" name="s8">Like many Lojban grammatical constructions, sentence modal

uses a signal both before the first construct and between the two: the use of ``both''
and ``and'' in the first half of this sentence represents a forethought connection
(though not a modal one).

    <p>To make forethought modal sentence connections in Lojban, place the modal plus
    ``gi'' before the first bridi, and ``gi'' between the two. No ``.i'' is used within
    the construct. The forethought equivalent of <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  ri'agi mi jgari le kabri
        gi mi jgari lei djacu
    With-physical-cause I grasp the cup,
        I grasp the-mass-of water.
    Because I grasp the cup, I grasp the water.
</pre>Note that the cause, the x1 of ``rinka'' is now placed first. To keep the two bridi
in the original order of <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a>, we could say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  seri'agi mi jgari lei djacu
        gi mi jgari le kabri
    With-physical-effect I grasp the-mass-of water,
        I grasp the cup.
</pre>

    <p>In English, the sentence ``*Therefore I grasp the water, I grasp the cup'' is
    ungrammatical, because ``therefore'' is not grammatically equivalent to ``because''.
    In Lojban, ``seri'agi'' can be used just like ``ri'agi''.</p>

    <p>When the two bridi joined by a modal connection have one or more elements (selbri
    or sumti or both) in common, there are various condensed forms that can be used in
    place of full modal sentence connection with both bridi completely stated.</p>

    <p>When the bridi are the same except for a single sumti, as in Examples 8.1 through
    8.3, then a sumti modal connection may be employed:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  mi jgari ri'agi le kabri gi lei djacu
    I grasp because the cup , the-mass-of water.
</pre><a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a> means exactly the same as <a href="#e8d1">Examples
8.1</a> through <a href="#e8d3">8.3</a>, but there is no idiomatic English translation
that will distinguish it from them.

    <p>If the two connected bridi are different in more than one sumti, then a termset
    may be employed. Termsets are explained more fully in <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>, but are essentially a mechanism for creating
    connections between multiple sumti simultaneously.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi dunda le cukta la djan.
        .imu'ibo la djan. dunda lei jdini mi
    I gave the book to John.
        Motivated-by John gave the-mass-of money to-me.
    I gave the book to John, because John gave money to me.
</pre>means the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  nu'i mu'igi mi le cukta la djan.
        gi la djan. lei jdini mi nu'u dunda
    [start] because I, the book, John;
        John, the-mass-of money, me [end] gives.
</pre>

    <p>Here there are three sumti in each half of the termset, because the two bridi
    share only their selbri.</p>

    <p>There is no modal connection between selbri as such: bridi which differ only in
    the selbri can be modally connected using bridi-tail modal connection. The bridi-tail
    construct is more fully explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>, but
    essentially it consists of a selbri with optional sumti following it. <a href=
    "#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> is suitable for bridi-tail connection, and could be shortened
    to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  mi mu'igi viska le cukta gi lebna le cukta
    I, because saw the book, took the book.
</pre>

    <p>Again, no straightforward English translation exists. It is even possible to
    shorten <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> further to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  mi mu'igi viska gi lebna vau le cukta
    I because saw, therefore took, the book.
</pre>where ``le cukta'' is set off by the non-elidable ``vau'' and is made to belong to
both bridi-tails --- see <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> for more explanations.

    <p>Since this is a chapter on rearranging sumti, it is worth pointing out that
    <a href="#e8d8">Example 8.8</a> can be further rearranged to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  mi le cukta mu'igi viska gi lebna
    I, the book, because saw, therefore took
</pre>which doesn't require the extra ``vau''; all sumti before a conjunction of
bridi-tails are shared.

    <p>Finally, mathematical operands can be modally connected.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>    li ny. du li vo
        .ini'ibo li ny. du li re su'i re
    the number n = the-number 4.
        Entailed-by the-number n = the-number 2 + 2.
    n = 4 because n = 2 + 2.
</pre>can be reduced to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e8d11" name="e8d11">8.11)</a>    li ny. du li
        ni'igi vei re su'i re [ve'o] gi vo
    the-number n = the-number
        because ( 2 + 2 ) therefore 4.
    n is 2 + 2, and is thus 4.
</pre>The cmavo ``vei'' and ``ve'o'' represent mathematical parentheses, and are required
so that ``ni'igi'' affects more than just the immediately following operand, namely the
first ``re''. (The right parenthesis, ``ve'o'', is an elidable terminator.) As usual, no
English translation does <a href="#e8d11">Example 8.11</a> justice.

    <p>Note: Due to restrictions on the Lojban parsing algorithm, it is not possible to
    form modal connectives using the ``fi'o''-plus-selbri form of modal. Only the
    predefined modals of selma'o BAI can be compounded as shown in <a href="#s7">Sections
    7</a> and <a href="#s8">8</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s9" name="s9">9. Modal selbri</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s9" name="s9">Consider the example:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s9" name="s9"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban.
        bai tu'a la frank.
    I speak in-language Lojban
        with-compeller some-property-of Frank.
    I speak in Lojban, under compulsion by Frank.
</pre><a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> has two modal sumti, using the modals ``bau'' and
``bai''. Suppose we wanted to specify the language explicitly but be vague about who's
doing the compelling. We can simplify <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi tavla bau la lojban. bai [ku].
    I speak in-language Lojban under-compulsion.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, the elidable terminator ``ku'' has taken the
    place of the sumti which would normally follow ``bai''. Alternatively, we could
    specify the one who compels but keep the language vague:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  mi tavla bau [ku]
        bai tu'a la frank.
    I speak in-some-language
        under-compulsion-by some-property-of Frank.
</pre>

    <p>We are also free to move the modal-plus-``ku'' around the bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  bau [ku] bai ku mi tavla
    In-some-language under-compulsion I speak.
</pre>An alternative to using ``ku'' is to place the modal cmavo right before the selbri,
following the ``cu'' which often appears there. When a modal is present, the ``cu'' is
almost never necessary.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  mi bai tavla bau la lojban.
    I compelledly speak in-language Lojban.
</pre>In this use, the modal is like a tanru modifier semantically, although
grammatically it is quite distinct. <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> is very similar in
meaning to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi se bapli tavla bau la lojban.
    I compelledly-speak in-language Lojban.
</pre>

    <p>The ``se'' conversion is needed because ``bapli tavla'' would be a compeller type
    of speaker rather than a compelled (by someone) type of speaker, which is what a
    ``bai tavla'' is.</p>

    <p>If the modal preceding a selbri is constructed using ``fi'o'', then ``fe'u'' is
    required to prevent the main selbri and the modal selbri from colliding:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  mi fi'o kanla fe'u viska do
    I with-eye see you
    I see you with my eye(s).
</pre>There are two other uses of modals. A modal can be attached to a pair of
bridi-tails that have already been connected by a logical, non-logical, or modal
connection (see <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> for more on logical and
non-logical connections):
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi bai
        ke ge klama le zarci gi cadzu le bisli [ke'e]
    I under-compulsion
        ( both go to-the market and walk on-the ice )
    Under compulsion, I both go to the market
        and walk on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ``bai'' is spread over both ``klama le zarci'' and ``cadzu le bisli'',
    and the ``ge ... gi'' represents the logical connection ``both-and'' between the
    two.</p>

    <p>Similarly, a modal can be attached to multiple sentences that have been combined
    with ``tu'e'' and ``tu'u'', which are explained in more detail in <a href=
    "chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  bai tu'e mi klama le zarci
        .i mi cadzu le bisli [tu'u]
    Under-compulsion [start] I go to-the market.
        I walk on-the ice [end]
</pre>means the same thing as <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a>.

    <p>Note: Either BAI modals or ``fi'o''-plus-selbri modals may correctly be used in
    any of the constructions discussed in this section.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s10" name="s10">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s10" name="s10">Relative phrases and clauses are explained in much more
    detail in</a> <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>. However, there is a construction
    which combines a modal with a relative phrase which is relevant to this chapter.
    Consider the following examples of relative clauses:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d1" name=
"e10d1">10.1)</a>    la .apasionatas. poi se cusku la .artr. rubnstain.
        cu se nelci mi
    The Appassionata which is-expressed-by Artur Rubenstein
        is-liked-by me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a> la .apasionatas. noi se finti la betovn.
        cu se nelci mi
    The Appassionata, which is-created-by Beethoven,
        is-liked-by me.
</pre>In <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a>, ``la .apasionatas.'' refers to a particular
performance of the sonata, namely the one performed by Rubenstein. Therefore, the
relative clause ``poi se cusku'' uses the cmavo ``poi'' (of selma'o NOI) to restrict the
meaning of ``la .apasionatas'' to the performance in question.

    <p>In <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a>, however, ``la .apasionatas.'' refers to the
    sonata as a whole, and the information that it was composed by Beethoven is merely
    incidental. The cmavo ``noi'' (also of selma'o NOI) expresses the incidental nature
    of this relationship.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``pe'' and ``ne'' (of selma'o GOI) are roughly equivalent to ``poi'' and
    ``noi'' respectively, but are followed by sumti rather than full bridi. We can
    abbreviate <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> and <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a>
    to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d3" name=
"e10d3">10.3)</a>    la .apasionatas pe la .artr. rubnstain. se nelci mi
    The Appassionata of Artur Rubenstein is-liked-by me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a> la .apasionatas ne la betovn. se nelci mi
    The Appassionata, which is of Beethoven, is-liked-by me.
</pre>Here the precise selbri of the relative clauses is lost: all we can tell is that
the Appassionata is connected in some way with Rubenstein (in <a href="#e10d3">Example
10.3</a>) and Beethoven (in <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a>), and that the
relationships are respectively restrictive and incidental.

    <p>It happens that both ``cusku'' and ``finti'' have BAI cmavo, namely ``cu'u'' and
    ``fi'e''. We can recast <a href="#e10d3">Example 10.3</a> and <a href=
    "#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    la .apasionatas pe cu'u la .artr. rubnstain.
        cu se nelci mi
    The Appassionata expressed-by Artur Rubenstein
        is-liked-by me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a> la .apasionatas ne fi'e la betovn.
        cu se nelci mi
    The Appassionata, invented-by Beethoven,
        is-liked-by me.
</pre><a href="#e10d5">Example 10.5</a> and <a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a> have the
full semantic content of <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> and <a href="#e10d2">Example
10.2</a> respectively.

    <p>Modal relative phrases are often used with the BAI cmavo ``mau'' and ``me'a'',
    which are based on the comparative gismu ``zmadu'' (more than) and ``mleca'' (less
    than) respectively. The place structures are:</p>
    <pre>
   zmadu   x1 is more than x2 in property/quantity x3
            by amount x4
    mleca   x1 is less than x2 in property/quantity x3
            by amount x4
</pre>

    <p>Here are some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    la frank. nelci la betis. ne semau la meiris.
    Frank likes Betty, which-is more-than Mary.
    Frank likes Betty more than (he likes) Mary.
</pre><a href="#e10d7">Example 10.7</a> requires that Frank likes Betty, but adds the
information that his liking for Betty exceeds his liking for Mary. The modal appears in
the form ``semau'' because the x2 place of ``zmadu'' is the basis for comparison: in this
case, Frank's liking for Mary.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    la frank. nelci la meiris. ne seme'a la betis.
    Frank likes Mary, which-is less-than Betty.
    Frank likes Mary less than (he likes) Betty.
</pre>Here we are told that Frank likes Mary less than he likes Betty; the information
about the comparison is the same. It would be possible to rephrase <a href=
"#e10d7">Example 10.7</a> using ``me'a'' rather than ``semau'', and <a href=
"#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> using ``mau'' rather than ``seme'a'', but such usage would be
unnecessarily confusing. Like many BAI cmavo, ``mau'' and ``me'a'' are more useful when
converted with ``se''.

    <p>If the ``ne'' were omitted in <a href="#e10d7">Example 10.7</a> and <a href=
    "#e10d8">Example 10.8</a>, the modal sumti (``la meiris.'' and ``la betis.''
    respectively) would become attached to the bridi as a whole, producing a very
    different translation. <a href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> would become:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    la frank. nelci la meiris. seme'a la betis.
    Frank likes Mary is-less-than Betty.
    Frank's liking Mary is less than Betty.
</pre>which compares a liking with a person, and is therefore nonsense.

    <p>Pure comparison, which states only the comparative information but says nothing
    about whether Frank actually likes either Mary or Betty (he may like neither, but
    dislike Betty less), would be expressed differently, as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>    le ni la frank. nelci la betis.
        cu zmadu le ni la frank. nelci la meiris.
    The quantity-of Frank's liking Betty
        is-more-than the quantity-of Frank's liking Mary.
</pre>The mechanisms explained in this section are appropriate to many modals other than
``semau'' and ``seme'a''. Some other modals that are often associated with relative
phrases are: ``seba'i'' (``instead of''), ``ci'u'' (``on scale''), ``de'i'' (``dated''),
``du'i'' (``as much as''). Some BAI tags can be used equally well in relative phrases or
attached to bridi; others seem useful only attached to bridi. But it is also possible
that the usefulness of particular BAI modals is an English-speaker bias, and that
speakers of other languages may find other BAIs useful in divergent ways.

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI
    modals and to ``fi'o''-plus-selbri modals.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s11" name="s11">11. Mixed modal connection</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s11" name="s11">It is possible to mix logical connection (explained in</a>
    <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>) with modal connection, in a way that
    simultaneously asserts the logical connection and the modal relationship. Consider
    the sentences:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    mi nelci do .ije mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  And I like Jane

    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    mi nelci do .iki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  Justified-by I like Jane.
</pre>The meanings of <a href="#e11d1">Example 11.1</a> and <a href="#e11d2">Example
11.2</a> can be simultaneously expressed by combining the two compound cmavo, thus:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    mi nelci do .ijeki'ubo mi nelci la djein.
    I like you.  And justified-by I like Jane.
</pre>Here the two sentences ``mi nelci do'' and ``mi nelci la djein.'' are
simultaneously asserted, their logical connection is asserted, and their causal
relationship is asserted. The logical connective ``je'' comes before the modal ``ki'u''
in all such mixed connections.

    <p>Since ``mi nelci do'' and ``mi nelci la djein.'' differ only in the final sumti,
    we can transform <a href="#e11d3">Example 11.3</a> into a mixed sumti connection:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    mi nelci do .eki'ubo la djein.
    I like you and/because Jane.
</pre>Note that this connection is an afterthought one. Mixed connectives are always
afterthought; forethought connectives must be either logical or modal.

    <p>There are numerous other afterthought logical and non-logical connectives that can
    have modal information planted within them. For example, a bridi-tail connected
    version of <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    mi nelci do gi'eki'ubo nelci la djein.

not pin down the ``mi bevri le dakli'' portion as the cause. It is legal for a modal (or
a tense; see <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>) to modify the whole of a ``tu'e ...
tu'u'' construct.

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI
    modals and to ``fi'o''-plus-selbri modals.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s12" name="s12">12. Modal conversion: JAI</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s12" name="s12">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s12" name="s12">   jai JAI modal conversion
    fai FA  modal place structure tag
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s12" name="s12">So far, conversion of numbered bridi places with SE and the
addition of modal places with BAI have been two entirely separate operations. However, it
is possible to convert a selbri in such a way that, rather than exchanging two numbered
places, a modal place is made into a numbered place. For example,</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    mi cusku bau la lojban.
    I express [something] in-language Lojban.
</pre>has an explicit x1 place occupied by ``mi'' and an explicit ``bau'' place occupied
by ``la lojban.'' To exchange these two, we use a modal conversion operator consisting of
``jai'' (of selma'o JAI) followed by the modal cmavo. Thus, the modal conversion of
<a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la lojban. jai bau cusku fai mi
    Lojban is-the-language-of-expression used-by me.
</pre>In <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a>, the modal place ``la lojban.'' has become the
x1 place of the new selbri ``jai bau cusku''. What has happened to the old x1 place?
There is no numbered place for it to move to, so it moves to a special ``unnumbered
place'' marked by the tag ``fai'' of selma'o FA.

    <p>Note: For the purposes of place numbering, ``fai'' behaves like ``fi'a''; it does
    not affect the numbering of the other places around it.</p>

    <p>Like SE conversions, JAI conversions are especially convenient in descriptions. We
    may refer to ``the language of an expression'' as ``le jai bau cusku'', for
    example.</p>

    <p>In addition, it is grammatical to use ``jai'' without a following modal. This
    usage is not related to modals, but is explained here for completeness. The effect of
    ``jai'' by itself is to send the x1 place, which should be an abstraction, into the
    ``fai'' position, and to raise one of the sumti from the abstract sub-bridi into the
    x1 place of the main bridi. This feature is discussed in more detail in <a href=
    "chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>. The following two examples mean the same thing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    le nu mi lebna le cukta
        cu se krinu le nu mi viska le cukta
    The event-of I take the book
        is-justified-by the event-of I see the book.
    My taking the book is justified by my seeing it.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a> mi jai se krinu le nu mi viska le cukta kei
        [fai le nu mi lebna le cukta]
    I am-justified by the event-of I see the book
        [namely, the event-of I take the book]
    I am justified in taking the book by seeing the book.
</pre><a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a>, with the bracketed part omitted, allows us to
say that ``I am justified'' whereas in fact it is my action that is justified. This
construction is vague, but useful in representing natural-language methods of expression.

    <p>Note: The uses of modals discussed in this section are applicable both to BAI
    modals and to ``fi'o''-plus-selbri modals.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s13" name="s13">13. Modal negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s13" name="s13">Negation is explained in detail in</a> <a href=
    "chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>. There are two forms of negation in Lojban:
    contradictory and scalar negation. Contradictory negation expresses what is false,
    whereas scalar negation says that some alternative to what has been stated is true. A
    simple example is the difference between ``John didn't go to Paris'' (contradictory
    negation) and ``John went to (somewhere) other than Paris'' (scalar negation).</p>

    <p>Contradictory negation involving BAI cmavo is performed by appending ``-nai'' (of
    selma'o NAI) to the BAI. A common use of modals with ``-nai'' is to deny a causal
    relationship:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi nelci do mu'inai le nu do nelci mi
    I like you, but not because you like me.
</pre><a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> denies that the relationship between my liking
you (which is asserted) and your liking me (which is not asserted) is one of motivation.
Nothing is said about whether you like me or not, merely that that hypothetical liking is
not the motivation for my liking you.

    <p>Scalar negation is achieved by prefixing ``na'e'' (of selma'o NAhE), or any of the
    other cmavo of NAhE, to the BAI cmavo.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    le spati cu banro na'emu'i le nu
        do djacu dunda fi le spati
    The plant grows other-than-motivated-by the event-of
        you water-give to the plant.
</pre><a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> says that the relationship between the plant's
growth and your watering it is not one of motivation: the plant is not motivated to grow,
as plants are not something which can have motivation as a rule. Implicitly, some other
relationship between watering and growth exists, but <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a>
doesn't say what it is (presumably ``ri'a'').

    <p>Note: Modals made with ``fi'o'' plus a selbri cannot be negated directly. The
    selbri can itself be negated either with contradictory or with scalar negation,
    however.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s14" name="s14">14. Sticky modals</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s14" name="s14">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s14" name="s14">   ki  KI  stickiness flag
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s14" name="s14">Like tenses, modals can be made persistent from the bridi in
which they appear to all following bridi. The effect of this ``stickiness'' is to make
the modal, along with its following sumti, act as if it appeared in every successive
bridi. Stickiness is put into effect by following the modal (but not any following sumti)
with the cmavo ``ki'' of selma'o KI. For example,</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e14d1" name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    mi tavla bau la lojban.
        bai ki tu'a la frank.
    .ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban.
    I speak in-language Lojban
        compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
    Afterward, I speak in-language English.
</pre>means the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    mi tavla bau la lojban.
        bai tu'a la frank.
    .ibabo mi tavla bau la gliban.
        bai tu'a la frank.
    I speak in-language Lojban
        compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
    Afterward, I speak in-language English
        compelled-by some-property-of Frank.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a>, ``bai'' is made sticky, and so Frank's
    compelling is made applicable to every following bridi. ``bau'' is not sticky, and so
    the language may vary from bridi to bridi, and if not specified in a particular
    bridi, no assumption can safely be made about its value.</p>

    <p>To cancel stickiness, use the form ``BAI ki ku'', which stops any modal value for
    the specified BAI from being passed to the next bridi. To cancel stickiness for all
    modals simultaneously, and also for any sticky tenses that exist (``ki'' is used for
    both modals and tenses), use ``ki'' by itself, either before the selbri or (in the
    form ``ki ku'') anywhere in the bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e14d3" name="e14d3">14.3)</a>    mi ki tavla
    I speak (no implication about language or compulsion).
</pre>Note: Modals made with ``fi'o''-plus-selbri cannot be made sticky. This is an
unfortunate, but unavoidable, restriction.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s15" name="s15">15. Logical and non-logical connection of modals</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-s15" name="s15">Logical and non-logical connectives are explained in detail
    in</a> <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. For the purposes of this chapter, it
    suffices to point out that a logical (or non-logical) connection between two bridi
    which differ only in a modal can be reduced to a single bridi with a connective
    between the modals. As a result, <a href="#e15d1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href=
    "#e15d2">Example 15.2</a> mean the same thing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e15d1" name="e15d1">15.1)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani
        .ije la frank. bajra teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination the house.
        And Frank runs with-origin the house.
    Frank runs to the house, and Frank runs from the house.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a je teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination and with-origin the house.
    Frank runs to and from the house.
</pre>Neither example implies whether a single act, or two acts, of running is referred
to. To compel the sentence to refer to a single act of running, you can use the form:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-9-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    la frank. bajra seka'a le zdani
        ce'e teka'a le zdani
    Frank runs with-destination the house
        [joined-to] with-origin the-house.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``ce'e'' creates a termset containing two terms (termsets are explained
    in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> and <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter
    16</a>). When a termset contains more than one modal tag derived from a single BAI,
    the convention is that the two tags are derived from a common event.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">This chapter attempts to document and explain the space/time
    tense system of Lojban. It does not attempt to answer all questions of the form ``How
    do I say such-and-such (an English tense) in Lojban?'' Instead, it explores the
    Lojban tense system from the inside, attempting to educate the reader into a Lojbanic
    viewpoint. Once the overall system is understood and the resources that it makes
    available are familiar, the reader should have some hope of using appropriate tense
    constructs and being correctly understood.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">The system of Lojban tenses presented here may seem really
    complex because of all the pieces and all the options; indeed, this chapter is the
    longest one in this book. But tense is in fact complex in every language. In your
    native language, the subtleties of tense are intuitive. In foreign languages, you are
    seldom taught the entire system until you have reached an advanced level. Lojban
    tenses are extremely systematic and productive, allowing you to express subtleties
    based on what they mean rather than on how they act similarly to English tenses. This
    chapter concentrates on presenting an intuitive approach to the meaning of Lojban
    tense words and how they may be creatively and productively combined.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">What is ``tense''? Historically, ``tense'' is the attribute
    of verbs in English and related languages that expresses the time of the action. In
    English, three tenses are traditionally recognized, conventionally called the past,
    the present, and the future. There are also a variety of compound tenses used in
    English. However, there is no simple relationship between the form of an English
    tense and the time actually expressed:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">I go to London tomorrow. I will go to London tomorrow. I
      am going to London tomorrow.</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s1" name="s1">all mean the same thing, even though the first sentence
    uses the present tense; the second, the future tense; and the third, a compound tense
    usually called ``present progressive''. Likewise, a newspaper headline says ``JONES
    DIES'', although it is obvious that the time referred to must be in the past. Tense
    is a mandatory category of English: every sentence must be marked for tense, even if
    in a way contrary to logic, because every main verb has a tense marker built into to
    it. By contrast, Lojban brivla have no implicit or explicit tense marker attached to
    them.</a>

    <p>In Lojban, the concept of tense extends to every selbri, not merely the verb-like
    ones. In addition, tense structures provide information about location in space as
    well as in time. All tense information is optional in Lojban: a sentence like:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the market.
</pre>can be understood as:

    <dl>
      <dd>I went to the market. I am going to the market. I have gone to the market. I
      will go to the market. I continually go to the market.</dd>
    </dl>as well as many other possibilities: context resolves which is correct.

    <p>The placement of a tense construct within a Lojban bridi is easy: right before the
    selbri. It goes immediately after the ``cu'', and can in fact always replace the
    ``cu'' (although in very complex sentences the rules for eliding terminators may be
    changed as a result). In the following examples, ``pu'' is the tense marker for
    ``past time'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  mi cu pu klama le zarci
    mi pu klama le zarci
    I in-the-past go-to the market.
    I went to the market.
</pre>It is also possible to put the tense somewhere else in the bridi by adding ``ku''
after it. This ``ku'' is an elidable terminator, but it's almost never possible to
actually elide it except at the end of the bridi:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  puku mi klama le zarci
    In-the-past I go-to the market.
    Earlier, I went to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>   mi klama puku le zarci

    I went earlier to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>   mi klama le zarci pu [ku]

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s2" name="s2">2. Spatial tenses: FAhA and VA</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s2" name="s2">   vi  VA  short distance

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s2" name="s2">(The complete list of FAhA cmavo can be found in</a>
    <a href="#s27">Section 27</a>.)

    <p>Why is this section about spatial tenses rather than the more familiar time tenses
    of <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, asks the reader? Because the model to be used in
    explaining both will be easier to grasp for space than for time. The explanation of
    time tenses will resume in <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>.</p>

    <p>English doesn't have mandatory spatial tenses. Although there are plenty of ways
    in English of showing where an event happens, there is absolutely no need to do so.
    Considering this fact may give the reader a feel for what the optional Lojban time
    tenses are like. From the Lojban point of view, space and time are interchangeable,
    although they are not treated identically.</p>

    <p>Lojban specifies the spatial tense of a bridi (the place at which it occurs) by
    using words from selma'o FAhA and VA to describe an imaginary journey from the
    speaker to the place referred to. FAhA cmavo specify the direction taken in the
    journey, whereas VA cmavo specify the distance gone. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  le nanmu va batci le gerku
    The man [medium distance] bites the dog.
    Over there the man is biting the dog.
</pre>What is at a medium distance? The event referred to by the bridi: the man biting
the dog. What is this event at a medium distance from? The speaker's location. We can
understand the ``va'' as saying: ``If you want to get from the speaker's location to the
location of the bridi, journey for a medium distance (in some direction unspecified).''
This ``imaginary journey'' can be used to understand not only <a href="#e2d1">Example
2.1</a>, but also every other spatial tense construct.

    <p>Suppose you specify a direction with a FAhA cmavo, rather than a distance with a
    VA cmavo:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  le nanmu zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [left] bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Here the imaginary journey is again from the speaker's location to the location of
    the bridi, but it is now performed by going to the left (in the speaker's reference
    frame) for an unspecified distance. So a reasonable translation is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>To my left, the man bites the dog.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The ``my'' does not have an explicit equivalent in the Lojban, because the
    speaker's location is understood as the starting point.</p>

    <p>(Etymologically, by the way, ``zu'a'' is derived from ``zunle'', the gismu for
    ``left'', whereas ``vi'', ``va'', and ``vu'' are intended to be reminiscent of
    ``ti'', ``ta'', and ``tu'', the demonstrative pronouns ``this-here'', ``that-there'',
    and ``that-yonder''.)</p>

    <p>What about specifying both a direction and a distance? The rule here is that the
    direction must come before the distance:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  le nanmu zu'avi batci le gerku
    The man [left] [short distance] bites the dog.
    Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>As explained in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, it would be perfectly correct to use
    ``ku'' to move this tense to the beginning or the end of the sentence to emphasize
    it:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  zu'aviku le nanmu cu batci le gerku
    [Left] [short distance] the man bites the dog.
    Slightly to my left, the man bites the dog.
</pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s3" name="s3">3. Compound spatial tenses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s3" name="s3">Humph, says the reader: this talk of ``imaginary journeys''
    is all very well, but what's the point of it? --- ``zu'a'' means ``on the left'' and
    ``vi'' means ``nearby'', and there's no more to be said. The imaginary-journey model
    becomes more useful when so-called compound tenses are involved. A compound tense is
    exactly like a simple tense, but has several FAhAs run together:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s3" name="s3"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s3" name="s3"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e3d1" name=
"e3d1">3.1)</a>  le nanmu ga'u zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [up] [left] bites the dog.
</pre>The proper interpretation of <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> is that the imaginary
journey has two stages: first move from the speaker's location upward, and then to the
left. A translation might read:

    <dl>
      <dd>Left of a place above me, the man bites the dog.</dd>
    </dl>(Perhaps the speaker is at the bottom of a manhole, and the dog-biting is going
    on at the edge of the street.)

    <p>In the English translation, the keywords ``left'' and ``above'' occur in reverse
    order to the Lojban order. This effect is typical of what happens when we ``unfold''
    Lojban compound tenses into their English equivalents, and shows why it is not very
    useful to try to memorize a list of Lojban tense constructs and their colloquial
    English equivalents.</p>

    <p>The opposite order also makes sense:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  le nanmu zu'a ga'u batci le gerku
    The man [left] [up] bites the dog.
    Above a place to the left of me, the man bites the dog.
</pre>In ordinary space, the result of going up and then to the left is the same as that
of going left and then up, but such a simple relationship does not apply in all
environments or to all directions: going south, then east, then north may return one to
the starting point, if that point is the North Pole.

    <p>Each direction can have a distance following:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  le nanmu zu'avi ga'uvu
        batci le gerku
    The man [left] [short distance] [up] [long distance]
        bites the dog.
    Far above a place slightly to the left of me,
        the man bites the dog.
</pre>A distance can also come at the beginning of the tense construct, without any
specified direction. (<a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>, with VA alone, is really a special
case of this rule when no directions at all follow.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  le nanmu vi zu'a batci le gerku
    The man [short distance] [left] bites the dog.
    Left of a place near me, the man bites the dog.
</pre>Any number of directions may be used in a compound tense, with or without specified
distances for each:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  le nanmu ca'uvi ni'ava
        ri'uvu ne'i
        batci le gerku
    The man [front] [short] [down] [medium]
        [right] [long] [within]
        bites the dog.
    Within a place a long distance to the right
        of a place which is a medium distance downward
        from a place a short distance in front of me,
        the man bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Whew! It's a good thing tense constructs are optional: having to say all that
    could certainly be painful. Note, however, how much shorter the Lojban version of
    <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a> is than the English version.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s4" name="s4">4. Temporal tenses: PU and ZI</a></h2>

    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s4" name="s4">   pu  PU  past

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s4" name="s4">Now that the reader understands spatial tenses, there are only
two main facts to understand about temporal tenses: they work exactly like the spatial
tenses, with selma'o PU and ZI standing in for FAhA and VA; and when both spatial and
temporal tense cmavo are given in a single tense construct, the temporal tense is
expressed first. (If space were expressed before time, then certain constructions would
be ambiguous.)</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  le nanmu pu batci le gerku
    The man [past] bites the dog.
    The man bit the dog.
</pre>means that to reach the dog-biting, you must take an imaginary journey through
time, moving towards the past an unspecified distance. (Of course, this journey is even
more imaginary than the ones talked about in the previous sections, since time-travel is
not an available option.)

    <p>Lojban recognizes three temporal directions: ``pu'' for the past, ``ca'' for the
    present, and ``ba'' for the future. (Etymologically, these derive from the
    corresponding gismu ``purci'', ``cabna'', and ``balvi''. See <a href="#s23">Section
    23</a> for an explanation of the exact relationship between the cmavo and the gismu.)
    There are many more spatial directions, since there are FAhA cmavo for both absolute
    and relative directions as well as ``direction-like relationships'' like
    ``surrounding'', ``within'', ``touching'', etc. (See <a href="#s27">Section 27</a>
    for a complete list.) But there are really only two directions in time: forward and
    backward, toward the future and toward the past. Why, then, are there three cmavo of
    selma'o PU?</p>

    <p>The reason is that tense is subjective: human beings perceive space and time in a
    way that does not necessarily agree with objective measurements. We have a sense of
    ``now'' which includes part of the objective past and part of the objective future,
    and so we naturally segment the time line into three parts. The Lojban design
    recognizes this human reality by providing a separate time-direction cmavo for the
    ``zero direction'', Similarly, there is a FAhA cmavo for the zero space direction:
    ``bu'u'', which means something like ``coinciding''.</p>

    <p>(Technical note for readers conversant with relativity theory: The Lojban time
    tenses reflect time as seen by the speaker, who is assumed to be a ``point-like
    observer'' in the relativistic sense: they do not say anything about physical
    relationships of relativistic interval, still less about implicit causality. The
    nature of tense is not only subjective but also observer-based.)</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of temporal tenses:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  le nanmu puzi batci le gerku
    The man [past] [short distance] bites the dog.
    A short time ago, the man bit the dog.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>   le nanmu pu pu batci le gerku
    The man [past] [past] bites the dog.
    Earlier than an earlier time than now,
        the man bit the dog.
    The man had bitten the dog.
    The man had been biting the dog.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>   le nanmu ba puzi batci le gerku
    The man [future] [past] [short] bites the dog.
    Shortly earlier than some time later than now,
        the man will bite the dog.
    Soon before then, the man will have bitten the dog.
    The man will have just bitten the dog.
    The man will just have been biting the dog.
</pre>What about the analogue of an initial VA without a direction? Lojban does allow an
initial ZI with or without following PUs:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  le nanmu zi pu batci le gerku
    The man [short] [past] bites the dog.
    Before a short time from or before now,
        the man bit or will bite the dog.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>   le nanmu zu batci le gerku
    The man [long] bites the dog.
    A long time from or before now,
        the man will bite or bit the dog.
</pre><a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> and <a href="#e4d6">Example 4.6</a> are perfectly
legitimate, but may not be very much used: ``zi'' by itself signals an event that happens
at a time close to the present, but without saying whether it is in the past or the
future. A rough translation might be ``about now, but not exactly now''.

    <p>Because we can move in any direction in space, we are comfortable with the idea of
    events happening in an unspecified space direction (``nearby'' or ``far away''), but
    we live only from past to future, and the idea of an event which happens ``nearby in
    time'' is a peculiar one. Lojban provides lots of such possibilities that don't seem
    all that useful to English-speakers, even though you can put them together
    productively; this fact may be a limitation of English.</p>

    <p>Finally, here are examples which combine temporal and spatial tense:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  le nanmu puzu vu batci le gerku

birth to death, and over the entire part of the earth where I spend my life. The cmavo of
VEhA (for space) and ZEhA (for time) can be added to any of the tense constructs we have

    In a small space, the child walks on the ice.
    The child walks about a small area of the ice.
</pre>means that her walking was done in a small area. Like the distances, the interval
sizes are classified only roughly as ``small, medium, large'', and are relative to the
context: a small part of a room might be a large part of a table in that room.

    <p>Here is an example using a time interval:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le verba ze'a cadzu le bisli
    The child [medium time interval] walks-on the ice.
    For a medium time, the child walks/walked/will walk
        on the ice.
</pre>Note that with no time direction word, <a href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> does not say
when the walking happened: that would be determined by context. It is possible to specify
both directions or distances and an interval, in which case the interval always comes
afterward:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  le verba pu ze'a

    The child [past] [medium time interval]
        walks-on the ice.
    For a medium time, the child walked on the ice.
    The child walked on the ice for a while.
</pre>In <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a>, the relationship of the interval to the
specified point in time or space is indeterminate. Does the interval start at the point,
end at the point, or is it centered on the point? By adding an additional direction cmavo
after the interval, this question can be conclusively answered:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  mi ca ze'ica cusku dei
    I [present] [short time interval -- present]
        express this-utterance.
    I am now saying this sentence.
</pre>means that for an interval starting a short time in the past and extending to a
short time in the future, I am expressing the utterance which is <a href="#e5d4">Example
5.4</a>. Of course, ``short'' is relative, as always in tenses. Even a long sentence
takes up only a short part of a whole day; in a geological context, the era of Homo
sapiens would only be a ``ze'i'' interval.

    <p>By contrast,</p>
    <pre>

been expressing <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a>. Here the imaginary journey starts at the
present, lays down one end point of the interval, moves into the past, and lays down the
other endpoint. Another example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  mi pu ze'aba citka le mi sanmi
    I [past] [medium time interval - future] eat my meal.
    For a medium time afterward, I ate my meal.
    I ate my meal for a while.
</pre>

    <p>With ``ca'' instead of ``ba'', <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a> becomes <a href=

    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  mi pu ze'aca citka le mi sanmi
    I [past] [medium time interval - present] eat my meal
    For a medium time before and afterward, I ate my meal.
    I ate my meal for a while.
</pre>because the interval would then be centered on the past moment rather than oriented
toward the future of that moment. The colloquial English translations are the same ---
English is not well-suited to representing this distinction.

    <p>Here are some examples of the use of space intervals with and without specified

</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e5d8">Example 5.8</a>, there is no equivalent in the colloquial
    English translation of the ``small interval'' which the fish occupies. Neither the
    Lojban nor the English expresses the orientation of the fish. Compare <a href=

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  mi pu klama le zarci
    I [past] go-to the market.
</pre>really means:

    <dl>
      <dd>At a moment in the past, and possibly other moments as well, the event ``I went
      to the market'' was in progress.</dd>
    </dl>The vague or unspecified interval contains an instant in the speaker's past.
    However, there is no indication whether or not the whole interval is in the speaker's
    past! It is entirely possible that the interval during which the going-to-the-market
    is happening stretches into the speaker's present or even future.

    <p><a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> points up a fundamental difference between Lojban
    tenses and English tenses. An English past-tense sentence like ``I went to the
    market'' generally signifies that the going-to-the-market is entirely in the past;
    that is, that the event is complete at the time of speaking. Lojban ``pu'' has no
    such implication.</p>

    <p>This property of a past tense is sometimes called ``aorist'', in reference to a
    similar concept in the tense system of Classical Greek. All of the Lojban tenses have
    the same property, however:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  le tricu ba crino
    the tree [future] is-green
    The tree will be green.
</pre>does not imply (as the colloquial English translation does) that the tree is not
green now. The vague interval throughout which the tree is, in fact, green may have
already started.

    <p>This general principle does not mean that Lojban has no way of indicating that a
    tree will be green but is not yet green. Indeed, there are several ways of expressing
    that concept: see <a href="#s10">Section 10</a> (event contours) and <a href=
    "#s20">Section 20</a> (logical connection between tenses).</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s7" name="s7">7. Dimensionality: VIhA</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s7" name="s7">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s7" name="s7">   vi'i    VIhA    on a line
    vi'a    VIhA    in an area

    vi'e    VIhA    throughout a space/time interval
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s7" name="s7">The cmavo of ZEhA are sufficient to express time intervals.
One fundamental difference between space and time, however, is that space is
multi-dimensional. Sometimes we want to say not only that something moves over a small
interval, but also perhaps that it moves in a line. Lojban allows for this. I can specify
that a motion ``in a small space'' is more specifically ``in a short line'', ``in a small
area'', or ``through a small volume''.</a>

    <p>What about the child walking on the ice in <a href="#e5d1">Examples 5.1</a>
    through <a href="#e5d3">5.3</a>? Given the nature of ice, probably the area
    interpretation is most sensible. I can make this assumption explicit with the
    appropriate member of selma'o VIhA:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  le verba ve'a vi'a
        cadzu le bisli
    The child [medium space interval] [2-dimensional]
        walks-on the ice.
    In a medium-sized area, the child walks on the ice.
</pre>Space intervals can contain either VEhA or VIhA or both, but if both, VEhA must
come first, as <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> shows.

    <p>The reader may wish to raise a philosophical point here. (Readers who don't wish
    to, should skip this paragraph.) The ice may be two-dimensional, or more accurately
    its surface may be, but since the child is three-dimensional, her walking must also
    be. The subjective nature of Lojban tense comes to the rescue here: the action is
    essentially planar, and the third dimension of height is simply irrelevant to
    walking. Even walking on a mountain could be called ``vi'a'', because relatively
    speaking the mountain is associated with an essentially two-dimensional surface.
    Motion which is not confined to such a surface (e.g., flying, or walking through a
    three-dimensional network of tunnels, or climbing among mountains rather than on a
    single mountain) would be properly described with ``vi'u''. So the cognitive, rather
    than the physical, dimensionality controls the choice of VIhA cmavo.</p>

    <p>VIhA has a member ``vi'e'' which indicates a 4-dimensional interval, one that
    involves both space and time. This allows the spatial tenses to invade, to some
    degree, the temporal tenses; it is possible to make statements about space-time
    considered as an Einsteinian whole. (There are presently no cmavo of FAhA assigned to
    ``pastward'' and ``futureward'' considered as space rather than time directions ---
    they could be added, though, if Lojbanists find space-time expression useful.) If a
    temporal tense cmavo is used in the same tense construct with a ``vi'e'' interval,
    the resulting tense may be self-contradictory.</p>

    To the right of me, the child walks on the ice.
</pre>In either case, however, the reference frame for defining ``right'' and ``left'' is
the speaker's, not the child's. This can be changed thus:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  le verba mo'i ri'u cadzu le bisli
        ma'i vo'a

    The child walks toward her right on the ice.
</pre><a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> is analogous to <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a>.
The cmavo ``ma'i'' belongs to selma'o BAI (explained in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
9</a>), and allows specifying a reference frame.

    <p>Both a regular and a ``mo'i''-flagged spatial tense can be combined, with the
    ``mo'i'' construct coming last:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  le verba zu'avu mo'i ri'uvi
        cadzu le bisli
    The child [left] [long] [movement] [right] [short]
        walks-on the ice.
    Far to the left of me, the child walks a short
        distance toward my right on the ice.
</pre>It is not grammatical to use multiple directions like ``zu'a ca'u'' after ``mo'i'',
but complex movements can be expressed in a separate bridi.

    <p>Here is an example of a movement tense on a bridi not inherently involving
    movement:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi mo'i ca'uvu citka le mi sanmi
    I [movement] [front] [long] eat my meal.
    While moving a long way forward, I eat my meal.
</pre>(Perhaps I am eating in an airplane.)

    <p>There is no parallel facility in Lojban at present for expressing movement in time
    --- time travel --- but one could be added easily if it ever becomes useful.</p>

holidays. More explicitly,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi puzu ze'u di'i
        velckule
    I [past] [long distance] [long interval] [regularly]
        am-a-pupil.
    Long ago I regularly attended school for a long time.
</pre>The four TAhE cmavo are differentiated as follows: ``ru'i'' covers the entirety of
the interval, ``di'i'' covers the parts of the interval which are systematically spaced
subintervals; ``na'o'' covers part of the interval, but exactly which part is determined
by context; ``ta'e'' covers part of the interval, selected with reference to the behavior
of the actor (who often, but not always, appears in the x1 place of the bridi).

    <p>Using TAhE does not require being so specific. Either the time direction or the
    time interval or both may be omitted (in which case they are vague). For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  mi ba ta'e klama le zarci
    I [future] [habitually] go-to the market.
    I will habitually go to the market.
    I will make a habit of going to the market.
</pre>specifies the future, but the duration of the interval is indefinite. Similarly,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  mi na'o klama le zarci
    I [typically] go-to the market
    I typically go/went/will go to the market
</pre>illustrates an interval property in isolation. There are no distance or direction
cmavo, so the point of time is vague; likewise, there is no interval cmavo, so the length
of the interval during which these goings-to-the-market take place is also vague. As
always, context will determine these vague values.

    <p>``Intermittently'' is the polar opposite notion to ``continuously'', and is
    expressed not with its own cmavo, but by adding the negation suffix ``-nai'' (which
    belongs to selma'o NAI) to ``ru'i''. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  le verba ru'inai cadzu le bisli
    The child [continuously-not] walks-on the ice.
    The child intermittently walks on the ice.
</pre>As shown in the cmavo table above, all the cmavo of TAhE may be negated with
``-nai''; ``ru'inai'' and ``di'inai'' are probably the most useful.

    <p>An intermittent event can also be specified by counting the number of times during
    the interval that it takes place. The cmavo ``roi'' (which belongs to selma'o ROI)
    can be appended to a number to make a quantified tense. Quantified tenses are common
    in English, but not so commonly named: they are exemplified by the adverbs ``never'',
    ``once'', ``twice'', ``thrice'', ... ``always'', and by the related phrases ``many
    times'', ``a few times'', ``too many times'', and so on. All of these are handled in
    Lojban by a number plus ``-roi'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi paroi klama le zarci
    I [one time] go-to the market.
    I go to the market once.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>   mi du'eroi klama le zarci
    I [too-many times] go-to the market.
    I go to the market too often.
</pre>With the quantified tense alone, we don't know whether the past, the present, or
the future is intended, but of course the quantified tense need not stand alone:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi pu reroi klama le zarci
    I [past] [two times] go-to the market.
    I went to the market twice.
</pre>The English is slightly over-specific here: it entails that both goings-to-
the-market were in the past, which may or may not be true in the Lojban sentence, since
the implied interval is vague. Therefore, the interval may start in the past but extend
into the present or even the future.

    <p>Adding ``-nai'' to ``roi'' is also permitted, and has the meaning ``other than
    (the number specified)'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  le ratcu reroinai citka le cirli
    The rat [twice-not] eats the cheese.
    The rat eats the cheese other than twice
</pre>

    <p>This may mean that the rat eats the cheese fewer times, or more times, or not at
    all.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to be careful with sentences like <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a>
    and <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a>, where a quantified tense appears without an
    interval. What <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> really says is that during an interval
    of unspecified size, at least part of which was set in the past, the event of my
    going to the market happened twice. The example says nothing about what happened
    outside that vague time interval. This is often less than we mean. If we want to nail
    down that I went to the market once and only once, we can use the cmavo ``ze'e''
    which represents the ``whole time interval'': conceptually, an interval which
    stretches from time's beginning to its end:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>    mi ze'e paroi klama le zarci
    I [whole interval] [once] go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Since specifying no ZEhA leaves the interval vague, <a href="#e9d8">Example
    9.8</a> might in appropriate context mean the same as <a href="#e9d10">Example
    9.10</a> after all --- but <a href="#e9d10">Example 9.10</a> allows us to be specific
    when specificity is necessary.</p>

    <p>A PU cmavo following ``ze'e'' has a slightly different meaning from one that
    follows another ZEhA cmavo. The compound cmavo ``ze'epu'' signifies the interval
    stretching from the infinite past to the reference point (wherever the imaginary
    journey has taken you); ``ze'eba'' is the interval stretching from the reference
    point to the infinite future. The remaining form, ``ze'eca'', makes specific the
    ``whole of time'' interpretation just given. These compound forms make it possible to
    assert that something has never happened without asserting that it never will.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e9d11" name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    mi ze'epu noroi klama le zarci
    I [whole interval] [past] [never] go-to the market.
    I have never gone to the market.
</pre>says nothing about whether I might go in future.

    <p>The space equivalent of ``ze'e'' is ``ve'e'', and it can be used in the same way
    with a quantified space tense: see <a href="#s11">Section 11</a> for an explanation
    of space interval modifiers.</p>

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s10" name="s10">The cmavo of selma'o ZAhO express the Lojban version of what
is traditionally called ``aspect''. This is not a notion well expressed by English
tenses, but many languages (including Chinese and Russian among Lojban's six source
languages) consider it more important than the specification of mere position in
time.</a>

    <p>The ``event contours'' of selma'o ZAhO, with their bizarre keywords, represent the
    natural portions of an event considered as a process, an occurrence with an internal
    structure including a beginning, a middle, and an end. Since the keywords are
    scarcely self-explanatory, each ZAhO will be explained in detail here. Note that from
    the viewpoint of Lojban syntax, ZAhOs are interval modifiers like TAhEs or ROI
    compounds; if both are found in a single tense, the TAhE/ROI comes first and the ZAhO
    afterward. The imaginary journey described by other tense cmavo moves us to the
    portion of the event-as-process which the ZAhO specifies.</p>

    <p>It is important to understand that ZAhO cmavo, unlike the other tense cmavo,
    specify characteristic portions of the event, and are seen from an essentially
    timeless perspective. The ``beginning'' of an event is the same whether the event is
    in the speaker's present, past, or future. It is especially important not to confuse
    the speaker-relative viewpoint of the PU tenses with the event-relative viewpoint of
    the ZAhO tenses.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and ``ba'o'' (etymologically derived from the PU
    cmavo) refer to an event that has not yet begun, that is in progress, or that has
    ended, respectively:</p>

    The child [perfective] walks-on the ice.
    The child is finished walking on the ice.
</pre>As discussed in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>, the simple PU cmavo make no
assumptions about whether the scope of a past, present, or future event extends into one
of the other tenses as well. <a href="#e10d1">Examples 10.1</a> through <a href="#e10d3">
    10.3</a> illustrate that these ZAhO cmavo do make such assumptions possible: the
    event in 10.1 has not yet begun, definitively; likewise, the event in 10.3 is
    definitely over.

    <p>Note that in <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> and <a href="#e10d3">Example
    10.3</a>, ``pu'o'' and ``ba'o'' may appear to be reversed: ``pu'o'', although
    etymologically connected with ``pu'', is referring to a future event; whereas
    ``ba'o'', connected with ``ba'', is referring to a past event. This is the natural
    result of the event-centered view of ZAhO cmavo. The inchoative, or ``pu'o'', part of
    an event, is in the ``pastward'' portion of that event, when seen from the
    perspective of the event itself. It is only by inference that we suppose that
    <a href="#e10d1">Example 10.1</a> refers to the speaker's future: in fact, no PU
    tense is given, so the inchoative part of the event need not be coincident with the
    speaker's present: ``pu'o'' is not necessarily, though in fact often is, the same as
    ``ca pu'o''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo in <a href="#e10d1">Examples 10.1</a> through <a href="#e10d3">10.3</a>
    refer to spans of time. There are also two points of time that can be usefully
    associated with an event: the beginning, marked by ``co'a'', and the end, marked by
    ``co'u''. Specifically, ``co'a'' marks the boundary between the ``pu'o'' and ``ca'o''
    parts of an event, and ``co'u'' marks the boundary between the ``ca'o'' and ``ba'o''
    parts:</p>
    <pre>

    <p>Compare <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> with:</p>

    I [future] [regularly] [initiative] run.
    I will regularly begin to run.
</pre>which illustrates the combination of a TAhE with a ZAhO.

    <p>A process can have two end points, one reflecting the ``natural end'' (when the
    process is complete) and the other reflecting the ``actual stopping point'' (whether
    complete or not). <a href="#e10d5">Example 10.5</a> may be contrasted with:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    mi pu mo'u citka le mi sanmi
    I [past] [completitive] eat my meal.
    I finished eating my meal.

    <p>In <a href="#e10d7">Example 10.7</a>, the meal has reached its natural end; in
    <a href="#e10d5">Example 10.5</a>, the meal has merely ceased, without necessarily
    reaching its natural end.</p>

    <p>A process such as eating a meal does not necessarily proceed uninterrupted. If it
    is interrupted, there are two more relevant point events: the point just before the
    interruption, marked by ``de'a'', and the point just after the interruption, marked

    I [future] [resumptive] eat my meal.
    I will resume eating my meal.
</pre>In addition, it is possible for a process to continue beyond its natural end. The
span of time between the natural and the actual end points is represented by ``za'o'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  le xirma ca za'o
        jivna bajra
    The horse [present] [superfective]
        compete-type-of runs.
    The horse keeps on running a race too long.
</pre>which means that it ran past the finish line (after the race was over --- in most
races, the runners do not stop right at the finish line).

    <p>An entire event can be treated as a single moment using the cmavo ``co'i'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>  la djan. pu co'i catra la djim
    John [past] [achievative] kills Jim.
    John was at the point in time where he killed Jim.
</pre>Finally, since an activity is cyclical, an individual cycle can be referred to
using a number followed by ``re'u'', which is the other cmavo of selma'o ROI:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d12" name="e10d12">10.12)</a>  mi pare'u klama le zarci
    I [first time] go-to the store.
    I go to the store for the first time
        (within a vague interval).
</pre>

    <p>Note the difference between:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d13" name="e10d13">10.13)</a>  mi pare'u paroi klama le zarci
    I [first time] [one time] go-to the store.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e10d14" name="e10d14">10.14)</a>  mi paroi pare'u klama le zarci

    <p>As shown in <a href="#e11d3">Example 11.3</a>, when a tense comes first in a

    is emphasized.</p>

    <p>The ``fe'e'' marker can also be used for the same purpose before members of ZAhO.
    (The cmavo ``be'a'' belongs to selma'o FAhA; it is the space direction meaning
    ``north of''.)</p>

    That is the south face of a rock.
</pre>Here the notion of a ``beginning point'' represented by the cmavo ``co'a'' is
transferred from ``beginning in time'' to ``beginning in space'' under the influence of
the ``fe'e'' flag. Space is not inherently oriented, unlike time, which flows from past
to future: therefore, some indication of orientation is necessary, and the ``ve'abe'a''
provides an orientation in which the south face is the ``beginning'' and the north face
is the ``end'', since the rock extends from south (near me) to north (away from me).

    <p>Many natural languages represent time by a space-based metaphor: in English, what
    is past is said to be ``behind us''. In other languages, the metaphor is reversed.
    Here, Lojban is representing space (or space interval modifiers) by a time-based
    metaphor: the choice of a FAhA cmavo following a VEhA cmavo indicates which direction
    is mapped onto the future. (The choice of future rather than past is arbitrary, but
    convenient for English-speakers.)</p>

    <p>If both a TAhE (or ROI) and a ZAhO are present as space interval modifiers, the
    ``fe'e'' flag must be prefixed to each.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s12" name="s12">12. Tenses as sumti tcita</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s12" name="s12">So far, we have seen tenses only just before the selbri, or
    (equivalently in meaning) floating about the bridi with ``ku''. There is another
    major use for tenses in Lojban: as sumti tcita, or argument tags. A tense may be used
    to add spatial or temporal information to a bridi as, in effect, an additional
    place:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s12" name="s12"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d1" name=
"e12d1">12.1)</a>    mi klama le zarci ca le nu
        do klama le zdani
    I go-to the market [present] the event-of
        you go-to the house.
    I go to the market when you go to the house.
</pre>Here ``ca'' does not appear before the selbri, nor with ``ku''; instead, it governs
the following sumti, the ``le nu'' construct. What <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a>
asserts is that the action of the main bridi is happening at the same time as the event
mentioned by that sumti. So ``ca'', which means ``now'' when used with a selbri, means
``simultaneously-with'' when used with a sumti. Consider another example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    mi klama le zarci pu le nu
        do pu klama le zdani
    I go-to the market [past] the event-of
        you [past] go-to the house.
</pre>

    <p>The second ``pu'' is simply the past tense marker for the event of your going to
    the house, and says that this event is in the speaker's past. How are we to
    understand the first ``pu'', the sumti tcita?</p>

    <p>All of our imaginary journeys so far have started at the speaker's location in
    space and time. Now we are specifying an imaginary journey that starts at a different
    location, namely at the event of your going to the house. <a href="#e12d2">Example
    12.2</a> then says that my going to the market is in the past, relative not to the
    speaker's present moment, but instead relative to the moment when you went to the
    house. <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> can therefore be translated:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>I had gone to the market before you went to the house.</dd>
    </dl>(Other translations are possible, depending on the ever-present context.)
    Spatial direction and distance sumti tcita are exactly analogous:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le panka
    The rat eats the cheese [short distance] the park.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a> le ratcu cu citka le cirla
        vi le vu panka
    The rat eats the cheese
        [short distance] the [long distance] park
    The rat eats the cheese near the faraway park.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a> le ratcu cu citka le cirla
        vu le vi panka
    The rat eats the cheese
        [long distance] the [short distance] park
    The rat eats the cheese far away from the nearby park.
</pre>The event contours of selma'o ZAhO (and their space equivalents, prefixed with
``fe'e'') are also useful as sumti tcita. The interpretation of ZAhO tcita differs from
that of FAhA, VA, PU, and ZI tcita, however. The event described in the sumti is viewed
as a process, and the action of the main bridi occurs at the phase of the process which
the ZAhO specifies, or at least some part of that phase. The action of the main bridi
itself is seen as a point event, so that there is no issue about which phase of the main
bridi is intended. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    mi morsi ba'o le nu mi jmive
    I am-dead [perfective] the event-of I live.
    I die in the aftermath of my living.
</pre>

    <p>Here the (point-)event of my being dead is the portion of my living-process which
    occurs after the process is complete. Contrast <a href="#e12d6">Example 12.6</a>
    with:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    mi morsi ba le nu mi jmive
    I am-dead [future] the event-of I live.
</pre>

    <p>As explained in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>, <a href="#e12d7">Example 12.7</a>
    does not exclude the possibility that I died before I ceased to live!</p>

    <p>Likewise, we might say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d8" name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    mi klama le zarci pu'o le nu mi citka
    I go-to the store [inchoative] the event-of I eat
</pre>which indicates that before my eating begins, I go to the store, whereas
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d9" name="e12d9">12.9)</a>    mi klama le zarci ba'o le nu mi citka
    I go-to the store [perfective] the event-of I eat
</pre>would indicate that I go to the store after I am finished eating.

    <p>Here is an example which mixes temporal ZAhO (as a tense) and spatial ZAhO (as a
    sumti tcita):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d10" name="e12d10">12.10)</a>  le bloti pu za'o xelklama
        fe'e ba'o le lalxu
    the boat [past] [superfective]
        is-a-transport-mechanism
        [space] [perfective] the lake.
    The boat sailed for too long and beyond the lake.
</pre>

    <p>Probably it sailed up onto the dock. One point of clarification: although
    ``xelklama'' appears to mean simply ``is-a-mode-of-transport'', it does not -- the
    bridi of <a href="#e12d10">Example 12.10</a> has four omitted arguments, and thus has
    the (physical) journey which goes on too long as part of its meaning.</p>

    <p>The remaining tense cmavo, which have to do with interval size, dimension, and
    continuousness (or lack thereof) are interpreted to let the sumti specify the
    particular interval over which the main bridi operates:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d11" name="e12d11">12.11)</a>  mi klama le zarci reroi le ca djedi
    I go-to the market [twice] the [present] day
    I go/went/will go to the market twice today.
</pre>Be careful not to confuse a tense used as a sumti tcita with a tense used within a
seltcita sumti:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e12d12" name="e12d12">12.12)</a>  loi snime cu carvi
        ze'u le ca dunra

        [long time interval] the [present] winter.
    Snow falls during this winter.

snowfall go, whereas

        ca le ze'u dunra
    some-of-the-mass-of snow rains

falls.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s13" name="s13">13. Sticky and multiple tenses: KI</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s13" name="s13">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s13" name="s13">   ki  KI  sticky tense set/reset
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s13" name="s13">So far we have only considered tenses in isolated bridi.
Lojban provides several ways for a tense to continue in effect over more than a single
bridi. This property is known as ``stickiness'': the tense gets ``stuck'' and remains in
effect until explicitly ``unstuck''. In the metaphor of the imaginary journey, the place
and time set by a sticky tense may be thought of as a campsite or way-station: it
provides a permanent origin with respect to which other tenses are understood. Later
imaginary journeys start from that point rather than from the speaker.</a>

    <p>To make a tense sticky, suffix ``ki'' to it:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi puki klama le zarci
        .i le nanmu cu batci le gerku
    I [past] [sticky] go-to the market.
         The man bites the dog.
    I went to the market.  The man bit the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Here the use of ``puki'' rather than just ``pu'' ensures that the tense will
    affect the next sentence as well. Otherwise, since the second sentence is tenseless,
    there would be no way of determining its tense; the event of the second sentence
    might happen before, after, or simultaneously with that of the first sentence.</p>

    <p>(The last statement does not apply when the two sentences form part of a
    narrative. See <a href="#s14">Section 14</a> for an explanation of ``story time'',
    which employs a different set of conventions.)</p>

    <p>What if the second sentence has a tense anyway?</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    mi puki klama le zarci
        .i le nanmu pu batci le gerku
    I [past] sticky go-to the market.
         The man [past] bites the dog.
</pre>

    <p>Here the second ``pu'' does not replace the sticky tense, but adds to it, in the
    sense that the starting point of its imaginary journey is taken to be the previously
    set sticky time. So the translation of <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d3" name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    I went to the market.
        The man had earlier bitten the dog.
</pre>and it is equivalent in meaning (when considered in isolation from any other
sentences) to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d4" name="e13d4">13.4)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
        .i le nanmu pupu batci le gerku
    I [past] go-to the market.
        The man [past] [past] bites the dog.
</pre>The point has not been discussed so far, but it is perfectly grammatical to have
more than one tense construct in a sentence:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d5" name="e13d5">13.5)</a>    puku mi ba klama le zarci
    [past] I [future] go-to the market.
    Earlier, I was going to go to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Here there are two tenses in the same bridi, the first floating free and specified
    by ``puku'', the second in the usual place and specified by ``ba''. They are
    considered cumulative in the same way as the two tenses in separate sentences of
    <a href="#e13d4">Example 13.4</a>. <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a> is therefore
    equivalent in meaning, except for emphasis, to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    mi puba klama le zarci
    I [past] [future] go-to the market.
    I was going to go to the market.
</pre>Compare <a href="#e13d7">Example 13.7</a> and <a href="#e13d8">Example 13.8</a>,
which have a different meaning from <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a> and <a href=
"#e13d6">Example 13.6</a>:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d7" name="e13d7">13.7)</a>    mi ba klama le zarci puku
    I [future] go-to the market [past].
    I will have gone to the market earlier.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a> mi bapu klama le zarci
    I [future] [past] go-to the market.
    I will have gone to the market.
</pre>

    <p>So when multiple tense constructs in a single bridi are involved, order counts ---
    the tenses cannot be shifted around as freely as if there were only one tense to
    worry about.</p>

    <p>But why bother to allow multiple tense constructs at all? They specify separate
    portions of the imaginary journey, and can be useful in order to make part of a tense
    sticky. Consider <a href="#e13d9">Example 13.9</a>, which adds a second bridi and a
    ``ki'' to <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a>:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>13.9</dt>

      <dd>pukiku mi ba klama le zarci .i le nanmu cu batci le gerku [past] [sticky] I
      [future] go-to the market. The man bites the dog.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>What is the implied tense of the second sentence? Not ``puba'', but only ``pu'',
    since only ``pu'' was made sticky with ``ki''. So the translation is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>I was going to go to the market. The man bit the dog.</dd>
    </dl>Lojban has several ways of embedding a bridi within another bridi: descriptions,
    abstractors, relative clauses. (Technically, descriptions contain selbri rather than
    bridi.) Any of the selbri of these subordinate bridi may have tenses attached. These
    tenses are interpreted relative to the tense of the main bridi:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d10" name="e13d10">13.10)</a>  mi pu klama le ba'o zarci
    I [past] go-to the [perfective] market
    I went to the former market.
</pre>

    <p>The significance of the ``ba'o'' in <a href="#e13d10">Example 13.10</a> is that
    the speaker's destination is described as being ``in the aftermath of being a
    market''; that is, it is a market no longer. In particular, the time at which it was
    no longer a market is in the speaker's past, because the ``ba'o'' is interpreted
    relative to the ``pu'' tense of the main bridi.</p>

    <p>Here is an example involving an abstraction bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d11" name="e13d11">13.11)</a>  mi ca jinvi le du'u mi ba morsi
    I now opine the fact-that I will-be dead.
    I now believe that I will be dead.
</pre>

    <p>Here the event of being dead is said to be in the future with respect to the
    opinion, which is in the present.</p>

    <p>``ki'' may also be used as a tense by itself. This cancels all stickiness and
    returns the bridi and all following bridi to the speaker's location in both space and
    time:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e13d12" name="e13d12">13.12)</a>  mi ki cusku dei
    I [here and now] express this-utterance.
    I say this sentence now.
</pre>In complex descriptions, multiple tenses may be saved and then used by adding a
subscript to ``ki''. A time made sticky with ``kixipa'' (ki-sub-1) can be returned to by
specifying ``kixipa'' as a tense by itself. In the case of written expression, the
writer's here-and-now is often different from the reader's, and a pair of subscripted
``ki'' tenses could be used to distinguish the two.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s14" name="s14">14. Story time</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s14" name="s14">Making strict use of the conventions explained in</a>
    <a href="#s13">Section 13</a> would be intolerably awkward when a story is being
    told. The time at which a story is told by the narrator is usually unimportant to the
    story. What matters is the flow of time within the story itself. The term ``story''
    in this section refers to any series of statements related in more-or-less
    time-sequential order, not just a fictional one.</p>

    <p>Lojban speakers use a different set of conventions, commonly called ``story
    time'', for inferring tense within a story. It is presumed that the event described
    by each sentence takes place some time more or less after the previous ones.
    Therefore, tenseless sentences are implicitly tensed as ``what happens next''. In
    particular, any sticky time setting is advanced by each sentence.</p>

</pre><a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> sets both the time (long ago) and the place (in a
cave) using ``ki'', just like the sentence sequences in <a href="#s13">Section 13</a>. No
further space cmavo are used in the rest of the story, so the place is assumed to remain
unchanged. The English translation of <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> is marked for
past tense also, as the conventions of English storytelling require: consequently, all
other English translation sentences are also in the past tense. (We don't notice how
strange this is; even stories about the future are written in past tense!) This
conventional use of past tense is not used in Lojban narratives.

    <p><a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a> is tenseless. Outside story time, it would be
    assumed that its event happens simultaneously with that of <a href="#e14d1">Example
    14.1</a>, since a sticky tense is in effect; the rules of story time, however, imply
    that the event occurs afterwards, and that the story time has advanced (changing the
    sticky time set in <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a>).</p>

    <p><a href="#e14d3">Example 14.3</a> has an explicit tense. This is taken relative to
    the latest setting of the sticky time; therefore, the event of <a href=
    "#e14d3">Example 14.3</a> happens before that of <a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a>.
    It cannot be determined if <a href="#e14d3">Example 14.3</a> happens before or after
    <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#e14d4">Example 14.4</a> is again tenseless. Story time was not changed
    by the flashback in <a href="#e14d3">Example 14.3</a>, so <a href="#e14d4">Example
    14.4</a> happens after <a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#e14d5">Example 14.5</a> specifies the future (relative to <a href=
    "#e14d4">Example 14.4</a>) and makes it sticky. So all further events happen after
    <a href="#e14d5">Example 14.5</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#e14d6">Example 14.6</a> and <a href="#e14d7">Example 14.7</a> are again
    tenseless, and so happen after <a href="#e14d5">Example 14.5</a>. (Story time is
    changed.)</p>

    <p>So the overall order is 14.1 - 14.3 - 14.2 - 14.4 - (medium interval) - 14.5 -
    14.6 - 14.7. It is also possible that 14.3 happens before 14.1.</p>

    <p>If no sticky time (or space) is set initially, the story is set at an unspecified
    time (or space): the effect is like that of choosing an arbitrary reference point and
    making it sticky. This style is common in stories that are jokes. The same convention
    may be used if the context specifies the sticky time sufficiently.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s15" name="s15">15. Tenses in subordinate bridi</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s15" name="s15">English has a set of rules, formally known as ``sequence of
    tense rules'', for determining what tense should be used in a subordinate clause,
    depending on the tense used in the main sentence. Here are some examples:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s15" name="s15"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d1" name=
"e15d1">15.1)</a>    John says that George is going to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a> John says that George went to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a> John said that George went to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d4" name="e15d4">15.4)</a> John said that George had gone to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e15d1">Example 15.1</a> and <a href="#e15d2">Example 15.2</a>, the
    tense of the main sentence is the present: ``says''. If George goes when John speaks,
    we get the present tense ``is going'' (``goes'' would be unidiomatic); if George goes
    before John speaks, we get the past tense ``went''. But if the tense of the main
    sentence is the past, with ``said'', then the tense required in the subordinate
    clause is different. If George goes when John speaks, we get the past tense ``went'';
    if George goes before John speaks, we get the past-perfect tense ``had gone''.</p>

    <p>The rule of English, therefore, is that both the tense of the main sentence and
    the tense of the subordinate clause are understood relative to the speaker (not John,
    but the person who speaks <a href="#e15d1">Examples 15.1</a> through <a href=
    "#e15d4">15.4</a>).</p>

    <p>Lojban, like Russian and Esperanto, uses a different convention. A tense in a
    subordinate bridi is understood to be relative to the tense already set in the main
    bridi. Thus <a href="#e15d1">Examples 15.1</a> through <a href="#e15d4">15.4</a> can
    be expressed in Lojban respectively thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d5" name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    la djan. ca cusku le se du'u
        la djordj. ca klama le zarci
    John [present] says the statement-that
        George [present] goes-to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d6" name="e15d6">15.6)</a> la djan. ca cusku le se du'u
        la djordj. pu klama le zarci
    John [present] says the statement-that
        George [past] goes-to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a> la djan. pu cusku le se du'u
        la djordj. ca klama le zarci
    John [past] says the statement-that
        George [present] goes-to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d8" name="e15d8">15.8)</a> la djan. pu cusku le se du'u
        la djordj. pu klama le zarci
    John [past] says the statement-that
        George [past] goes-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Probably the most counterintuitive of the Lojban examples is <a href=
    "#e15d7">Example 15.7</a>. The ``ca'' looks quite odd, as if George were going to the
    market right now, rather than back when John spoke. But this ``ca'' is really a
    ``ca'' with respect to a reference point specified by the outer ``pu''. This behavior
    is the same as the additive behavior of multiple tenses in the same bridi, as
    explained in <a href="#s13">Section 13</a>.</p>

    <p>There is a special cmavo ``nau'' (of selma'o CUhE) which can be used to override
    these rules and get to the speaker's current reference point. (Yes, it sounds like
    English ``now''.) It is not grammatical to combine ``nau'' with any other cmavo in a
    tense, except by way of a logical or non-logical connection (see <a href=
    "#s20">Section 20</a>). Here is a convoluted sentence with several nested bridi which
    uses ``nau'' at the lowest level:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e15d9" name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    la djan. pu cusku le se du'u
        la .alis pu cusku le se du'u
            la djordj. pu cusku le se du'u
                la maris. nau klama le zarci
    John [past] says the statement-that
        Alice [past] says the statement-that
            George [past] says the statement that
                Mary [now] goes-to the market.
    John said that Alice had said that George had earlier
        said that Mary is now going to the market.
</pre>The use of ``nau'' does not affect sticky tenses.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s16" name="s16">16. Tense relations between sentences</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s16" name="s16">The sumti tcita method, explained in</a> <a href=
    "#s12">Section 12</a>, of asserting a tense relationship between two events suffers

        the man bites the dog.
</pre>which specifies an imaginary journey leftward from the man biting the dog to the
child walking on the ice, claims only that the child walks on the ice. By the nature of
``le nu'', the man's biting the dog is merely referred to without being claimed. If it
seems desirable to claim both, each event can be expressed as a main sentence bridi, with
a special form of ``.i'' connecting them:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .izu'abo le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
        [Left] the child walks-on the ice.
    The  man bites the dog.  To the left, the child
        walks on the ice.
</pre>``.izu'abo'' is a compound cmavo: the ``.i'' separates the sentences and the
``zu'a'' is the tense. The ``bo'' is required to prevent the ``zu'a'' from gobbling up
the following sumti, namely ``le verba''.

    <p>Note that the bridi in <a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a> appear in the reverse
    order from their appearance in <a href="#e16d1">Example 16.1</a>. With ``.izu'abo''
    (and all other afterthought tense connectives) the sentence specifying the origin of
    the journey comes first. This is a natural order for sentences, but requires some
    care when converting between this form and the sumti tcita form.</p>

    <p><a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a> means the same thing as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku

    The man bites the dog.
        Left of what I just mentioned,
        the child walks on the ice.
</pre>If the ``bo'' is omitted, the meaning changes:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d4" name="e16d4">16.4)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .i zu'a le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
         [Left] the child [something] walks-on the ice.
    The man bites the dog. To the left of the child,
        something walks on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>Here the first place of the second sentence is unspecified, because ``zu'a'' has
    absorbed the sumti ``le verba''.</p>

    <p>Do not confuse either <a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a> or <a href=
    "#e16d4">Example 16.4</a> with the following:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d5" name="e16d5">16.5)</a>    le nanmu cu batci le gerku
        .i zu'aku le verba cu cadzu le bisli
    The man bites the dog.
        [Left] the child walks-on the ice.
    The man bites the dog.  Left of me, the child walks
        on the ice.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e16d5">Example 16.5</a>, the origin point is the speaker, as is usual
    with ``zu'aku''. <a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a> makes the origin point of the
    tense the event described by the first sentence.</p>

    <p>Two sentences may also be connected in forethought by a tense relationship. Just
    like afterthought tense connection, forethought tense connection claims both
    sentences, and in addition claims that the time or space relationship specified by
    the tense holds between the events the two sentences describe.</p>

    <p>The origin sentence is placed first, preceded by a tense plus ``gi''. Another
    ``gi'' is used to separate the sentences:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d6" name="e16d6">16.6)</a>    pugi mi klama le zarci gi mi klama le zdani
    [past] I go-to the market [,] I go-to the house.
    Before I go to the market, I go to the house.
</pre>

    <p>A parallel construction can be used to express a tense relationship between
    sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d7" name="e16d7">16.7)</a>    mi klama pugi le zarci gi le zdani
    I go-to [past] the market [,] the house.
</pre>

    <p>Because English does not have any direct way of expressing a tense-like
    relationship between nouns, <a href="#e16d7">Example 16.7</a> cannot be expressed in
    English without paraphrasing it either into <a href="#e16d6">Example 16.6</a> or else
    into ``I go to the house before the market'', which is ambiguous --- is the market
    going?</p>

    <p>Finally, a third forethought construction expresses a tense relationship between
    bridi-tails rather than whole bridi. (The construct known as a ``bridi-tail'' is
    explained fully in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>; roughly speaking, it is a
    selbri with any following sumti.) <a href="#e16d8">Example 16.8</a> is equivalent in
    meaning to <a href="#e16d6">Example 16.6</a> and <a href="#e16d7">Example
    16.7</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e16d8" name="e16d8">16.8)</a>    mi pugi klama le zarci gi klama le zdani
    I [past] go-to the market [,] go-to the house.
    I, before going to the market, go to the house.
</pre>In both <a href="#e16d7">Example 16.7</a> and <a href="#e16d8">Example 16.8</a>,
the underlying sentences ``mi klama le zarci'' and ``mi klama le zdani'' are not claimed;
only the relationship in time between them is claimed.

    <p>Both the forethought and the afterthought forms are appropriate with PU, ZI, FAhA,
    VA, and ZAhO tenses. In all cases, the equivalent forms are (where X and Y stand for
    sentences, and TENSE for a tense cmavo):</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>subordinate: X TENSE le nu Y afterthought coordinate: Y .i+TENSE+bo X
      forethought coordinate: TENSE+gi X gi Y</dd>

    It is false that I am dead during my life.
</pre>It is also possible to perform scalar negation of whole tense constructs by placing
a member of NAhE before them. Unlike contradictory negation, scalar negation asserts a
truth: that the bridi is true with some tense other than that specified. The following
examples are scalar negation analogues of <a href="#e18d1">Examples 18.1</a> to
    <a href="#e18d3">18.3</a>:

</pre>Unlike ``-nai'' contradictory negation, scalar negation of tenses is not limited to
PU and FAhA:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e18d9" name="e18d9">18.9)</a>    le verba na'e ri'u cadzu le bisli
    The child [non-] [right] walks-on the ice
    The child walks on the ice other than to my right.
</pre>The use of ``-nai'' on cmavo of TAhE and ROI has already been discussed in
    <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>; this use is also a scalar negation.

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s19" name="s19">Lojban bridi without tense markers may not necessarily refer
to actual events: they may also refer to capabilities or potential events. For
example:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d1" name="e19d1">19.1)</a>    ro datka cu flulimna
    all ducks are-float-swimmers
    All ducks swim by floating.
</pre>is a Lojban truth, even though the colloquial English translation is false or at
best ambiguous. This is because the tenseless Lojban bridi doesn't necessarily claim that
every duck is swimming or floating now or even at a specific time or place. Even if we
add a tense marker to <a href="#e19d1">Example 19.1</a>,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d2" name="e19d2">19.2)</a>    ro datka ca flulimna
    all ducks [present] are-float-swimmers.
    All ducks are now swimming by floating.
</pre>the resulting <a href="#e19d2">Example 19.2</a> might still be considered a truth,
even though the colloquial English seems even more likely to be false. All ducks have the
potential of swimming even if they are not exercising that potential at present. To get
the full flavor of ``All ducks are now swimming'', we must append a marker from selma'o
CAhA to the tense, and say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d3" name="e19d3">19.3)</a>    ro datka ca ca'a flulimna
    all ducks [present] [actual] are-float-swimmers
    All ducks are now actually swimming by floating.
</pre>A CAhA cmavo is always placed after any other tense cmavo, whether for time or for
space. However, a CAhA cmavo comes before ``ki'', so that a CAhA condition can be made
sticky.

    <p><a href="#e19d3">Example 19.3</a> is false in both Lojban and English, since it
    claims that the swimming is an actual, present fact, true of every duck that exists,
    whereas in fact there is at least one duck that is not swimming now.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, some ducks are dead (and therefore sink); some ducks have just
    hatched (and do not know how to swim yet), and some ducks have been eaten by
    predators (and have ceased to exist as separate objects at all). Nevertheless, all
    these ducks have the innate capability of swimming --- it is part of the nature of
    duckhood. The cmavo ``ka'e'' expresses this notion of innate capability:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d4" name="e19d4">19.4)</a>    ro datka ka'e flulimna
    all ducks [capable] are-float-swimmers.
    All ducks are innately capable of swimming.
</pre>Under some epistemologies, innate capability can be extended in order to apply the
innate properties of a mass to which certain individuals belong to the individuals
themselves, even if those individuals are themselves not capable of fulfilling the claim
of the bridi. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d5" name="e19d5">19.5)</a>    la djan. ka'e viska
    John [capable] sees.
    John is innately capable of seeing.
    John can see.
</pre>might be true about a human being named John, even though he has been blind since
birth, because the ability to see is innately built into his nature as a human being. It
is theoretically possible that conditions might occur that would enable John to see (a
great medical discovery). On the other hand,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d6" name="e19d6">19.6)</a>    le cukta ka'e viska
    The book [capable] sees.
    The book can see.
</pre>is not true in most epistemologies, since the ability to see is not part of the
innate nature of a book.

    <p>Consider once again the newly hatched ducks mentioned earlier. They have the
    potential of swimming, but have not yet demonstrated that potential. This may be
    expressed using ``nu'o'', the cmavo of CAhA for undemonstrated potential:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d7" name="e19d7">19.7)</a>    ro cifydatka nu'o flulimna
    all infant-ducks [can but has not] are-float-swimmers.
    All infant ducks have an undemonstrated potential
        for swimming by floating.
    Baby ducks can swim but haven't yet.
</pre>Contrariwise, if Frank is not blind from birth, then ``pu'i'' is appropriate:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d8" name="e19d8">19.8)</a>    la frank. pu'i viska
    Frank [can and has] sees.
    Frank has demonstrated a potential for seeing.
    Frank can see and has seen.
</pre>Note that the glosses given at the beginning of this section for ``ca'a'',
``nu'o'', and ``pu'i'' incorporate ``ca'' into their meaning, and are really correct for
``ca ca'a'', ``ca nu'o'', and ``ca pu'i''. However, the CAhA cmavo are perfectly
meaningful with other tenses than the present:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d9" name="e19d9">19.9)</a>    mi pu ca'a klama le zarci
    I [past] [actual] go-to the store.
    I actually went to the store.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d10" name="e19d10">19.10)</a>   la frank. pu nu'o klama le zdani
    Frank [past] [can but has not] goes-to the store.
    Frank could have, but will not have, gone to the
        store (at some understood moment in the
        future).
</pre>As always in Lojban tenses, a missing CAhA can have an indeterminate meaning, or
the context can be enough to disambiguate it. Saying
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d11" name="e19d11">19.11)</a>  ta jelca
    That burns/is-burning/might-burn/will-burn.
</pre>with no CAhA specified can translate the two very different English sentences
``That is on fire'' and ``That is inflammable.'' The first demands immediate action
(usually), whereas the second merely demands caution. The two cases can be disambiguated
with:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d12" name="e19d12">19.12)</a>  ta ca ca'a jelca
    That [present] [actual] burns.

    That [capable] burns.
    That is capable of burning.
    That is inflammable.
</pre>When no indication is given, as in the simple observative
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e19d14" name="e19d14">19.14)</a>  fagri
    fire
</pre>the prudent Lojbanist will assume the meaning ``Fire!''

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s20" name="s20">20. Logical and non-logical connections between
    tenses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s20" name="s20">Like many things in Lojban, tenses may be logically
    connected; logical connection is explained in more detail in</a> <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. Some of the terminology in this section will be
    clear only if you already understand logical connectives.</p>

    <p>The appropriate logical connectives belong to selma'o JA. A logical connective
    between tenses can always be expanded to one between sentences:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d1" name="e20d1">20.1)</a>    mi pu je ba klama le zarci
    I [past] and [future] go-to the market.
    I went and will go to the market.
</pre>means the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d2" name="e20d2">20.2)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
        .ije mi ba klama le zarci
    I [past] go-to the market.
        And I [future] go-to the market.
    I went to the market, and I will go to the market.
</pre>Tense connection and tense negation are combined in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d3" name="e20d3">20.3)</a>    mi punai je canai je ba
        klama le zarci
    I [past] [not] and [present] [not] and [future]
        go-to the market.
    I haven't yet gone to the market, but I will in future.
</pre><a href="#e20d3">Example 20.3</a> is far more specific than
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d4" name="e20d4">20.4)</a>    mi ba klama le zarci
    I [future] go-to the market.
</pre>which only says that I will go, without claiming anything about my past or present.
``ba'' does not imply ``punai'' or ``canai''; to compel that interpretation, either a
logical connection or a ZAhO is needed.

    <p>Tense negation can often be removed in favor of negation in the logical connective
    itself. The following examples are equivalent in meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d5" name="e20d5">20.5)</a>    mi mo'izu'anai je mo'iri'u cadzu
    I [motion] [left-not] and [motion] [right] walk.
    I walk not leftward but rightward.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d6" name="e20d6">20.6)</a> mi mo'izu'a naje mo'iri'u cadzu
    I [motion] [left] not-and [motion] [right] walk.
    I walk not leftward but rightward.  
</pre>There are no forethought logical connections between tenses allowed by the grammar,
to keep tenses simpler. Nor is there any way to override simple left-grouping of the
connectives, the Lojban default.

    <p>The non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI, BIhI, and GAhO are also permitted
    between tenses. One application is to specify intervals not by size, but by their
    end-points (``bi'o'' belongs to selma'o BIhI, and connects the end-points of an
    ordered interval, like English ``from ... to''):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e20d7" name="e20d7">20.7)</a>    mi puza bi'o bazu vasxu
    I [past] [medium] from ... to [future] [long] breathe.
    I breathe from a medium time ago till a long time
        to come.
</pre>(It is to be hoped that I have a long life ahead of me.)

    <p>One additional use of non-logical connectives within tenses is discussed in
    <a href="#s21">Section 21</a>. Other uses will probably be identified in future.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s21" name="s21">21. Sub-events</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s21" name="s21">Another application of non-logical tense connection is to
    talk about sub-events of events. Consider a six-shooter: a gun which can fire six
    bullets in succession before reloading. If I fire off the entire magazine twice, I
    can express the fact in Lojban thus:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s21" name="s21"></a></p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s21" name="s21"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e21d1" name="e21d1">21.1)</a>    mi reroi pi'u xaroi
        cecla le seldanti
    I [twice] [cross-product] [six times]
        shoot the projectile-launcher.
    On two occasions, I fire the gun six times.
</pre>It would be confusing, though grammatical, to run the ``reroi'' and the ``xaroi''
directly together. However, the non-logical connective ``pi'u'' expresses a Cartesian
product (also known as a cross product) of two sets. In this case, there is a set of two
firings each of which is represented by a set of six shots, for twelve shots in all
(hence the name ``product'': the product of 2 and 6 is 12). Its use specifies very
precisely what occurs.

    <p>In fact, you can specify strings of interval properties and event contours within
    a single tense without the use of a logical or non-logical connective cmavo. This
    allows tenses of the type:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e21d2" name="e21d2">21.2)</a>    la djordj. ca'o co'a ciska

    The market is-gone-to by-me.
</pre>It is also possible to bring a place that is specified by a sumti tcita (for the
purposes of this chapter, a tense sumti tcita) to the front, by using ``jai'' plus the
tense as the grammatical equivalent of SE:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e22d3" name="e22d3">22.3)</a>    le ratcu cu citka le cirla vi le panka

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e22d4" name="e22d4">22.4)</a> le panka cu jai vi citka le cirla fai le ratcu
    The park is-the-place-of eating the cheese by-the rat.
    The park is where the rat eats the cheese.
</pre>In <a href="#e22d4">Example 22.4</a>, the construction JAI+tense converts the
location sumti into the first place. The previous first place has nowhere to go, since
the location sumti is not a numbered place; however, it can be inserted back into the
bridi with ``fai'', the indefinite member of selma'o FA.

    <p>(The other members of FA are used to mark the first, second, etc. places of a
    bridi explicitly:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e22d5" name="e22d5">22.5)</a>    fa mi cu klama fe le zarci

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e22d7" name="e22d7">22.7)</a>    mi cu klama le zarci
</pre>in which the place structure is determined by position.)

    <p>Like SE conversion, JAI+tense conversion is especially useful in descriptions with

    I saw the place-of eating the cheese.
</pre>

    <p>Here the eater of the cheese is elided, so no ``fai'' appears.</p>

    <p>Of course, temporal tenses are also usable with JAI:</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s23" name="s23">23. Tenses versus modals</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s23" name="s23">Grammatically, every use of tenses seen so far is exactly
    paralleled by some use of modals as explained in</a> <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
    9</a>. Modals and tenses alike can be followed by sumti, can appear before the
    selbri, can be used in pure and mixed connections, can participate in JAI
    conversions. The parallelism is perfect. However, there is a deep difference in the
    semantics of tense constructs and modal constructs, grounded in historical
    differences between the two forms. Originally, modals and tenses were utterly
    different things in earlier versions of Loglan; only in Lojban have they become
    grammatically interchangeable. And even now, differences in semantics continue to be
    maintained.</p>

    <p>The core distinction is that whereas the modal bridi</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e23d1" name="e23d1">23.1)</a>    mi nelci do mu'i le nu do nelci mi
    I like you with-motivation the event-of you like me.
    I like you because you like me.
</pre>places the ``le nu'' sumti in the x1 place of the gismu ``mukti'' (which underlies
the modal ``mu'i''), namely the motivating event, the tensed bridi
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e23d2" name="e23d2">23.2)</a>    mi nelci do ba le nu do nelci mi
    I like you after the event-of you like me.
    I like you after you like me.
</pre>places the ``le nu'' sumti in the x2 place of the gismu ``balvi'' (which underlies
the tense ``ba''), namely the point of reference for the future tense. Paraphrases of
<a href="#e23d1">Example 23.1</a> and <a href="#e23d2">Example 23.2</a>, employing the
brivla ``mukti'' and ``balvi'' explicitly, would be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e23d3" name="e23d3">23.3)</a>    le nu do nelci mi cu mukti le nu mi nelci do
    The event-of you like me motivates the event-of I like you
    Your liking me is the motive for my liking you.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e23d4" name="e23d4">23.4)</a>    le nu mi nelci do cu balvi le nu do nelci mi
    The event-of I like you is after the event of you like me.
    My liking you follows (in time) your liking me.
</pre>(Note that the paraphrase is not perfect due to the difference in what is claimed;
<a href="#e23d3">Example 23.3</a> and <a href="#e23d4">Example 23.4</a> claim only the
causal and temporal relationships between the events, not the existence of the events
themselves.)

    <p>As a result, the afterthought sentence-connective forms of <a href=
    "#e23d1">Example 23.1</a> and <a href="#e23d2">Example 23.2</a> are,
    respectively:</p>
    <pre>

    I like you.  [That is] Because you like me.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e23d6" name="e23d6">23.6)</a> do nelci mi .ibabo mi nelci do
    You like me.  Afterward, I like you.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e23d5">Example 23.5</a>, the order of the two bridi ``mi nelci do''
    and ``do nelci mi'' is the same as in <a href="#e23d1">Example 23.1</a>. In <a href=
    "#e23d6">Example 23.6</a>, however, the order is reversed: the origin point ``do
    nelci mi'' physically appears before the future-time event ``mi nelci do''. In both
    cases, the bridi characterizing the event in the x2 place appears before the bridi
    characterizing the event in the x1 place of ``mukti'' or ``balvi''.</p>

    <p>In forethought connections, however, the asymmetry between modals and tenses is
    not found. The forethought equivalents of <a href="#e23d5">Example 23.5</a> and
    <a href="#e23d6">Example 23.6</a> are</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>X .i TENSE bo Y TENSE gi X gi Y Y TENSE le nu X</dd>
    </dl>neglecting the question of what is claimed. In the modal sentence schemata, the
    modal tag is always followed by Y, the sentence representing the event in the x1
    place of the gismu that underlies the BAI. In the tensed sentences, no such simple
    rule exists.

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s24" name="s24">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s24" name="s24">   cu'e    CUhE    tense question
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s24" name="s24">There are two main ways to ask questions about tense. The
main English tense question words are ``When?'' and ``Where?''. These may be paraphrased
respectively as ``At what time?'' and ``At what place?'' In these forms, their Lojban
equivalents simply involve a tense plus ``ma'', the Lojban sumti question:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d1" name="e24d1">24.1)</a>    do klama le zdani ca ma
    you go-to the house [present] [what sumti?].
    You go to the house at what time?
    When do you go to the house?

    The child [short space] [what sumti?] [past]
        walks-on the ice.
    The child at/near what place walked on the ice?
    Where did the child walk on the ice?
</pre>There is also a non-specific tense and modal question, ``cu'e'', belonging to
selma'o CUhE. This can be used wherever a tense or modal construct can be used.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d3" name="e24d3">24.3)</a>    le nanmu cu'e batci le gerku
    The man [what tense?] bites the dog.
    When/Where/How does the man bite the dog?
</pre>Possible answers to <a href="#e24d3">Example 24.3</a> might be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d4" name="e24d4">24.4)</a>    va

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d6" name="e24d6">24.6)</a> vi le lunra
    [short space] The moon.
    On the moon.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d7" name="e24d7">24.7)</a> pu'o

</pre>or even the modal reply (from selma'o BAI; see <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter

    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d8" name="e24d8">24.8)</a>    bai la djan.
    Under John's compulsion.
</pre>The only way to combine ``cu'e'' with other tense cmavo is through logical
connection, which makes a question that pre-specifies some information:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d9" name="e24d9">24.9)</a>    do puzi je cu'e sombo le gurni
    You [past] [short] and [when?] sow the grain?
    You sowed the grain a little while ago;
        when else do you sow it?
</pre>

    <p>Additionally, the logical connective itself can be replaced by a question
    word:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e24d10" name="e24d10">24.10)</a>  la .artr. pu je'i ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] [which?] [future] is-a-king
    Was Arthur a king or will he be?
</pre>

    <p>Answers to <a href="#e24d10">Example 24.10</a> would be logical connectives such
    as ``je'', meaning ``both'', ``naje'' meaning ``the latter'', or ``jenai'' meaning
    ``the former''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s25" name="s25">25. Explicit magnitudes</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-s25" name="s25">It is a limitation of the VA and ZI system of specifying
    magnitudes that they can only prescribe vague magnitudes: small, medium, or large. In
    order to express both an origin point and an exact distance, the Lojban construction
    called a ``termset'' is employed. (Termsets are explained further in</a> <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a> and <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>.) It is
    grammatical for a termset to be placed after a tense or modal tag rather than a
    sumti, which allows both the origin of the imaginary journey and its distance to be
    specified. Here is an example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e25d1" name="e25d1">25.1)</a>    la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i la djordj.
        lu'a lo mitre
            be li mu [nu'u]
    Frank stands [left] [start termset] George
        [quantity] a thing-measuring-in-meters
            the-number 5 [end termset].
    Frank is standing five meters to the left of George.
</pre>

    <p>Here the termset extends from the ``nu'i'' to the implicit ``nu'u'' at the end of
    the sentence, and includes the terms ``la djordj.'', which is the unmarked origin
    point, and the tagged sumti ``lo mitre be li mu'', which the cmavo ``la'u'' (of
    selma'o BAI, and meaning ``with quantity''; see <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
    9</a>) marks as a quantity. Both terms are governed by the tag ``zu'a''</p>

    <p>It is not necessary to have both an origin point and an explicit magnitude: a
    termset may have only a single term in it. A less precise version of <a href=
    "#e25d1">Example 25.1</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-10-e25d2" name="e25d2">25.2)</a>    la frank. sanli zu'a nu'i lu'a
        lo mitre be li mu
    Frank stands [left] [termset] [quantity]
        a thing-measuring-in-meters the-number 5.
    Frank stands five meters to the left.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s1" name="s1">1. The syntax of abstraction</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s1" name="s1">The purpose of the feature of Lojban known as ``abstraction''
    is to provide a means for taking whole bridi and packaging them up, as it were, into
    simple selbri. Syntactically, abstractions are very simple and uniform; semantically,
    they are rich and complex, with few features in common between one variety of
    abstraction and another. We will begin by discussing syntax without regard to
    semantics; as a result, the notion of abstraction may seem unmotivated at first. Bear
    with this difficulty until</a> <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>.</p>

    <p>An abstraction selbri is formed by taking a full bridi and preceding it by any
    cmavo of selma'o NU. There are twelve such cmavo; they are known as ``abstractors''.
    The bridi is closed by the elidable terminator ``kei'', of selma'o KEI. Thus, to
    change the bridi</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the store
</pre>into an abstraction using ``nu'', one of the members of selma'o NU, we change it
into
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  nu mi klama le zarci [kei]
    an-event-of my going-to the store
</pre>The bridi may be a simple selbri, or it may have associated sumti, as here. It is
important to beware of eliding ``kei'' improperly, as many of the common uses of
abstraction selbri involve following them with words that would appear to be part of the
abstraction if ``kei'' had been elided.

    <p>(Technically, ``kei'' is never necessary, because the elidable terminator ``vau''
    that closes every bridi can substitute for it; however, ``kei'' is specific to
    abstractions, and using it is almost always clearer.)</p>

    <p>The grammatical uses of an abstraction selbri are exactly the same as those of a
    simple brivla. In particular, abstraction selbri may be used as observatives, as in
    <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a>, or used in tanru:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  la djan. cu nu sonci kei djica
    John is-an-(event-of being-a-soldier) type-of desirer.
    John wants to be a soldier.
</pre>Abstraction selbri may also be used in descriptions, preceded by ``le'' (or any
other member of selma'o LE):
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  la djan. cu djica le nu sonci [kei]
    John desires the event-of being-a-soldier.
</pre>

    <p>We will most often use descriptions containing abstraction either at the end of a
    bridi, or just before the main selbri with its ``cu''; in either of these
    circumstances, ``kei'' can normally be elided.</p>

    <p>The place structure of an abstraction selbri depends on the particular abstractor,
    and will be explained individually in the following sections.</p>

    <p>Note: In glosses of bridi within abstractions, the grammatical form used in the
    English changes. Thus, in the gloss of <a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> we see ``my
    going-to the store'' rather than ``I go-to the store''; likewise, in the glosses of
    <a href="#e1d3">Example 1.3</a> and <a href="#e1d4">Example 1.4</a> we see
    ``being-a-soldier'' rather than ``is-a-soldier''. This procedure reflects the desire
    for more understandable glosses, and does not indicate any change in the Lojban form.
    A bridi is a bridi, and undergoes no change when it is used as part of an abstraction
    selbri.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s2" name="s2">2. Event abstraction</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s2" name="s2">   nu  NU  event abstractor
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s2" name="s2">The examples in</a> <a href="#s1">Section 1</a> made use of
``nu'' as the abstractor, and it is certainly the most common abstractor in Lojban text.
Its purpose is to capture the event or state of the bridi considered as a whole. Do not
confuse the ``le'' description built on a ``nu'' abstraction with ordinary descriptions
based on ``le'' alone. The following sumti are quite distinct:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  le klama
    the comer, that which comes

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   le se klama
    the destination

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>   le te klama
    the origin

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>   le ve klama
    the route

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>   le xe klama
    the means of transportation

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>   le nu klama
    the event of someone coming to somewhere
        from somewhere by some route using some means
</pre><a href="#e2d1">Examples 2.1</a> through <a href="#e2d5">2.5</a> are descriptions
that isolate the five individual sumti places of the selbri ``klama''. <a href="#e2d6">
    Example 2.6</a> describes something associated with the bridi as a whole: the event
    of it.

    <p>In Lojban, the term ``event'' is divorced from its ordinary English sense of
    something that happens over a short period of time. The description:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  le nu mi vasxu
    the event-of my breathing
</pre>is an event which lasts for the whole of my life (under normal circumstances). On
the other hand,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  le nu la djan. cinba la djein.
    the event-of John kissing Jane
</pre>is relatively brief by comparison (again, under normal circumstances).

    <p>We can see from <a href="#e2d6">Examples 2.6</a> through <a href="#e2d8">2.8</a>
    that ellipsis of sumti is valid in the bridi of abstraction selbri, just as in the
    main bridi of a sentence. Any sumti may be ellipsized if the listener will be able to
    figure out from context what the proper value of it is, or else to recognize that the
    proper value is unimportant. It is extremely common for ``nu'' abstractions in
    descriptions to have the x1 place ellipsized:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>  mi nelci le nu limna
    I like the event-of swimming.
    I like swimming.
</pre>is elliptical, and most probably means:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d10" name="e2d10">2.10)</a>    mi nelci le nu mi limna
    I like the event-of I swim.
</pre>

    <p>In the proper context, of course, <a href="#e2d9">Example 2.9</a> could refer to
    the event of somebody else swimming. Its English equivalent, ``I like swimming'',
    can't be interpreted as ``I like Frank's swimming''; this is a fundamental
    distinction between English and Lojban. In Lojban, an omitted sumti can mean whatever
    the context indicates that it should mean.</p>

    <p>Note that the lack of an explicit NU cmavo in a sumti can sometimes hide an
    implicit abstraction. In the context of <a href="#e2d10">Example 2.10</a>, the
    appearance of ``le se nelci'' (``that which is liked'') is in effect an
    abstraction:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d11" name="e2d11">2.11)</a>    le se nelci cu cafne
    The liked-thing is-frequent.
    The thing which I like happens often.
</pre>which in this context means

    <dl>
      <dd>My swimming happens often.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Event descriptions with ``le nu'' are commonly used to fill the ``under
    conditions...'' places, among others, of gismu and lujvo place structures:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e2d12" name="e2d12">2.12)</a>    la lojban. cu frili mi
        le nu mi tadni [kei]
    Lojban is-easy for-me
        under-conditions-the event-of I study
    Lojban is easy for me when I study.
</pre>(The ``when'' of the English would also be appropriate for a construction involving
a Lojban tense, but the Lojban sentence says more than that the studying is concurrent
with the ease.)

    <p>The place structure of a ``nu'' abstraction selbri is simply:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is an event of (the bridi)</dd>
    </dl>

</pre>The abstractors in <a href="#e3d1">Examples 3.1</a> through <a href="#e3d4">3.4</a>
could all have been replaced by ``nu'', with some loss of precision. Note that Lojban
allows every sort of event to be viewed in any of these four ways:

    <dl>
      <dd>the ``state of running'' begins when the runner starts and ends when the runner
      stops;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dd>the ``activity of running'' consists of the cycle ``lift leg, step forward,
      drop leg, lift other leg...'' (each such cycle is a process, but the activity
      consists in the repetition of the cycle);</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dd>the ``process of running'' puts emphasis on the initial sprint, the steady
      speed, and the final slowdown;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dd>the ``achievement of running'' is most alien to English, but sees the event of
      running as a single indivisible thing, like ``Pheidippides' run from Marathon to
      Athens'' (the original marathon).</dd>

    another way, the things of which ``nu'' selbri may correctly be predicated) are only
    moderately ``abstract''. They are still closely tied to happenings in space and time.
    Properties, however, are much more ethereal. What is ``the property of being blue'',
    or ``the property of being a go-er''? They are what logicians call ``intensions''. If
    John has a heart, then ``the property of having a heart'' is an abstract object
    which, when applied to John, is true. In fact,</a></p>

        the property-of having-as-heart something.
    John has the property of having a heart.
</pre>(The English word ``have'' frequently appears in any discussion of Lojban
properties: things are said to ``have'' properties, but this is not the same sense of
``have'' as in ``I have money'', which is possession.)

    <p>Property descriptions, like event descriptions, are often wanted to fill places in
    brivla place structures:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  do cnino mi
        le ka xunre [kei]
    You are-new to-me
        in-the-quality-of-the property-of being-red.
    You are new to me in redness.
</pre>(The English suffix ``-ness'' often signals a property abstraction, as does the
suffix ``-ity''.)

    <p>We can also move the property description to the x1 place of <a href=
    "#e4d3">Example 4.3</a>, producing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  le ka do xunre [kei] cu cnino mi
    The property-of your being-red is-new to me.
    Your redness is new to me.
</pre>It would be suitable to use <a href="#e4d3">Examples 4.3</a> and <a href="#e4d4">
    4.4</a> to someone who has returned from the beach with a sunburn.

    <p>There are several different properties that can be extracted from a bridi,
    depending on which place of the bridi is ``understood'' as being specified
    externally. Thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  ka mi prami [zo'e] [kei]
    a-property-of me loving something-unspecified
</pre>is quite different from
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  ka [zo'e] prami mi [kei]
    a-property-of something-unspecified loving me
</pre>

    <p>In particular, sentences like <a href="#e4d7">Example 4.7</a> and <a href=
    "#e4d8">Example 4.8</a> are quite different in meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X)
    I love John more than I love George.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d8" name="e4d8">4.8)</a>   la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka prami mi
    John exceeds George in the property of (X loves me).
    John loves me more than George loves me.
</pre>

    <p>The ``X'' used in the glosses of <a href="#e4d7">Examples 4.7</a> through <a href=
    "#e4d8">4.8</a> as a place-holder cannot be represented only by ellipsis in Lojban,
    because ellipsis means that there must be a specific value that can fill the
    ellipsis, as mentioned in <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>. Instead, the cmavo ``ce'u'' of
    selma'o KOhA is employed when an explicit sumti is wanted. (The form ``X'' will be
    used in literal translations.)</p>

    <p>Therefore, an explicit equivalent of <a href="#e4d7">Example 4.7</a>, with no
    ellipsis, is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d9" name="e4d9">4.9)</a>  la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka mi prami ce'u
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (I love X).
</pre>and of <a href="#e4d8">Example 4.8</a> is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d10" name="e4d10">4.10)</a>    la djan. cu zmadu la djordj. le ka ce'u prami mi
    John exceeds George in-the property-of (X loves me).
</pre>

    <p>This convention allows disambiguation of cases like:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d11" name="e4d11">4.11)</a>    le ka [zo'e] dunda le xirma [zo'e] [kei]
    the property-of giving the horse
</pre>into
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d12" name="e4d12">4.12)</a>    le ka ce'u dunda le xirma
        [zo'e] [kei]
    the property-of (X is-a-giver of-the horse
        to someone-unspecified)
    the property of being a giver of the horse
</pre>which is the most natural interpretation of <a href="#e4d11">Example 4.11</a>,
versus
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e4d13" name="e4d13">4.13)</a>    le ka [zo'e] dunda
        le xirma ce'u [kei]
    the property-of (someone-unspecified
        is-a-giver of-the horse to X)
    the property of being one to whom the horse is given
</pre>which is also a possible interpretation.

    <p>It is also possible to have more than one ``ce'u'' in a ``ka'' abstraction, which
    transforms it from a property abstraction into a relationship abstraction, a resource
    of the language that has not yet been explored.</p>

    <p>The place structure of ``ka'' abstraction selbri is simply:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is a property of (the bridi)</dd>
    </dl>

    the amount of Jane's mother-ness (?)
    the amount of mother-ness in Jane (?)
</pre>makes very little sense in either Lojban or English. We simply do not have any sort
of measurement scale for being a mother.

    <p>Semantically, a sumti with ``le ni'' is a number; however, it cannot be treated
    grammatically as a quantifier in Lojban unless prefixed by the mathematical cmavo
    ``mo'e'':</p>

    <p>Mathematical Lojban is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is explained more
    fully in <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>.</p>

    <p>There are contexts where either property or amount abstractions make sense, and in
    such constructions, amount abstractions can make use of ``ce'u'' just like property
    abstractors. Thus,</p>
    <pre>

    The picture varies in how blue it is.
    The picture varies in blueness.
</pre><a href="#e5d4">Example 5.4</a> conveys that the blueness comes and goes, whereas
<a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a> conveys that its quantity changes over time.

    <p>Whenever we talk of measurement of an amount, there is some sort of scale, and so
    the place structure of ``ni'' abstraction selbri is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the amount of (the bridi) on scale x2</dd>
    </dl>Note: the best way to express the x2 places of abstract sumti is to use
    something like ``le ni ... kei be''. See <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a> for the use
    of this construction.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s6" name="s6">6. Truth-value abstraction: ``jei''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s6" name="s6">The ``blueness of the picture'' discussed in</a> <a href=
    "#s5">Section 5</a> refers to the measurable amount of blue pigment (or other source
    of blueness), not to the degree of truth of the claim that blueness is present. That
    abstraction is expressed in Lojban using ``jei'', which is closely related
    semantically to ``ni''. In the simplest cases, ``le jei'' produces not a number but a
    truth value:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  le jei li re su'i re du li vo [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 4
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 4
</pre>is equivalent to ``truth'', and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  le jei li re su'i re du li mu [kei]
    the truth-value-of the-number 2 + 2 = the-number 5
    the truth of 2 + 2 being 5
</pre>is equivalent to ``falsehood''.

    <p>However, not everything in life (or even in Lojban) is simply true or false. There
    are shades of gray even in truth value, and ``jei'' is Lojban's mechanism for
    indicating the shade of grey intended:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi ba jdice le jei
        la djordj. cu zekri gasnu [kei]
    I [future] decide the truth-value of
        (George being-a-(crime doer)).
    I will decide whether George is a criminal.
</pre><a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> does not imply that George is, or is not,
definitely a criminal. Depending on the legal system I am using, I may make some
intermediate decision. As a result, ``jei'' requires an x2 place analogous to that of
``ni'':

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the truth value of (the bridi) under epistemology x2</dd>
    </dl>Abstractions using ``jei'' are the mechanism for fuzzy logic in Lojban; the
    ``jei'' abstraction refers to a number between 0 and 1 inclusive (as distinct from
    ``ni'' abstractions, which are often on open-ended scales). The detailed conventions
    for using ``jei'' in fuzzy-logic contexts have not yet been established.

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s7" name="s7">There are some selbri which demand an entire predication as a
sumti; they make claims about some predication considered as a whole. Logicians call
these the ``propositional attitudes'', and they include (in English) things like knowing,
believing, learning, seeing, hearing, and the like. Consider the English sentence:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  I know that Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    <p>How's that in Lojban? Let us try:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  mi djuno le nu la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the event of Frank being a fool.
</pre>Not quite right. Events are actually or potentially physical, and can't be
contained inside one's mind, except for events of thinking, feeling, and the like;
<a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a> comes close to claiming that Frank's being-a-fool is
purely a mental activity on the part of the speaker. (In fact, <a href="#e7d2">Example
7.2</a> is an instance of improperly marked ``sumti raising'', a concept discussed
further in <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>).

    <p>Try again:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  mi djuno le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the truth-value of Frank being a fool.
</pre>

    <p>Closer. <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> says that I know whether or not Frank is a
    fool, but doesn't say that he is one, as <a href="#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> does. To
    catch that nuance, we must say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  mi djuno le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I know the predication that Frank is a fool.
</pre>

    <p>Now we have it. Note that the implied assertion ``Frank is a fool'' is not a
    property of ``le du'u'' abstraction, but of ``djuno''; we can only know what is in
    fact true. (As a result, ``djuno'' like ``jei'' has a place for epistemology, which
    specifies how we know.) <a href="#e7d5">Example 7.5</a> has no such implied
    assertion:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  mi kucli le du'u la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I am curious about whether Frank is a fool.
</pre>and here ``du'u'' could probably be replaced by ``jei'' without much change in
meaning:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  mi kucli le jei la frank. cu bebna [kei]
    I am curious about how true it is
        that Frank is a fool.
</pre>As a matter of convenience rather than logical necessity, ``du'u'' has been given
an x2 place, which is a sentence (piece of language) expressing the bridi:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the predication (the bridi), expressed in sentence x2</dd>
    </dl>and ``le se du'u ...'' is very useful in filling places of selbri which refer to

    <p>``le se du'u'' is much the same as ``lu'e le du'u'', a symbol for the predication,

    <pre>

</pre>we can also say things like
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  I know who went to the store.
</pre>This form is called an ``indirect question'' in English because the embedded
English sentence is a question: ``Who went to the store?'' A person who says <a href=
"#e8d2">Example 8.2</a> is claiming to know the answer to this question. Indirect
questions can occur with many other English verbs as well: I can wonder, or doubt, or
see, or hear, as well as know who went to the store.

    <p>To express indirect questions in Lojban, we use a ``le du'u'' abstraction, but
    rather than using a question word like ``who'' (``ma'' in Lojban), we use any word
    that will fit grammatically and mark it with the suffix particle ``kau''. This cmavo
    belongs to selma'o UI, so grammatically it can appear anywhere. The simplest Lojban
    translation of <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a> is therefore:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi djuno le du'u
        makau pu klama le zarci
    I know the predication-of
        X [indirect question] [past] going to the store.
</pre>In <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a>, we have chosen to use ``ma'' as the word marked
by ``kau''. In fact, any other sumti would have done as well: ``zo'e'' or ``da'' or even
``la djan.''. Using ``la djan.'' would suggest that it was John who I knew had gone to
the store, however:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  mi djuno le du'u

    I know the predication-of/fact-that
        John [indirect question] [past]
            going to the store.
    I know who went to the store, namely John.
    I know that it was John who went to the store.
</pre>

    <p>Using one of the indefinite pro-sumti such as ``ma'', ``zo'e'', or ``da'' does not
    suggest any particular value.</p>

    <p>Why does Lojban require the ``kau'' marker, rather than using ``ma'' as English

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  Who is it that I know goes to the store?
</pre>It is actually not necessary to use ``le du'u'' and ``kau'' at all if the indirect
question involves a sumti; there is generally a paraphrase of the type:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  mi djuno fi le pu klama be le zarci
    I know about the [past] goer to-the store.
    I know something about the one who went to the store
        (namely, his identity).
</pre>because the x3 place of ``djuno'' is the subject of knowledge, as opposed to the
fact that is known. But when the questioned point is not a sumti, but (say) a logical
connection, then there is no good alternative to ``kau'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  mi ba zgana le du'u

            is-at the park.
    I will see whether John or George (or both)
        is at the park.
</pre>

    <p>In addition, <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> is only a loose paraphrase of
    <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a>, because it is left to the listener's insight to
    realize that what is known about the goer-to-the-store is his identity rather than
    some other of his attributes.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s9" name="s9">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s9" name="s9">   li'i    NU  experience abstractor
    si'o    NU  concept abstractor
    su'u    NU  general abstractor
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s9" name="s9">There are three more abstractors in Lojban, all of them little
used so far. The abstractor ``li'i'' expresses experience:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi morji le li'i mi verba
    I remember the experience-of (my being-a-child)
</pre>The abstractor ``si'o'' expresses a mental image, a concept, an idea:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi nelci le si'o la lojban. cu mulno
    I enjoy the concept-of Lojban being-complete.
</pre>Finally, the abstractor ``su'u'' is a vague abstractor, whose meaning must be
grasped from context:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  ko zgana le su'u
        le ci smacu cu bajra
    you [imperative] observe the abstract-nature-of
        the three mice running
    See how the three mice run!
</pre>All three of these abstractors have an x2 place. An experience requires an
experiencer, so the place structure of ``li'i'' is:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the experience of (the bridi) as experienced by x2</dd>
    </dl>Similarly, an idea requires a mind to hold it, so the place structure of
    ``si'o'' is:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the idea/concept of (the bridi) in the mind of x2</dd>
    </dl>Finally, there needs to be some way of specifying just what sort of abstraction
    ``su'u'' is representing, so its place structure is:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is an abstract nature of (the bridi) of type x2</dd>
    </dl>The x2 place of ``su'u'' allows it to serve as a substitute for any of the other
    abstractors, or as a template for creating new ones. For example,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  le nu mi klama
    the event-of my going
</pre>can be paraphrased as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  le su'u mi klama kei be lo fasnu
    the abstract-nature-of (my going) of-type an event
</pre>and there is a book whose title might be rendered in Lojban as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  le su'u la .iecuas. kuctra
        selcatra kei
        be lo sao'rdzifa'a

    the abstract-nature-of (Jesus is-an-intersect-shape
        type-of-killed-one)
        of-type a slope-low-direction
        type-of non-motor-vehicle speed-competition
    The Crucifixion of Jesus Considered As A
        Downhill Bicycle Race
</pre>

    <p>Note the importance of using ``kei'' after ``su'u'' when the x2 of ``su'u'' (or
    any other abstractor) is being specified; otherwise, the ``be lo'' ends up inside the
    abstraction bridi.</p>

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s10" name="s10">It is sometimes inconvenient, in a situation where an
abstract description is logically required, to express the abstraction. In English we can
say:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    I try to open the door.
</pre>which in Lojban is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi troci le nu
        [mi] gasnu le nu
            le vorme cu karbi'o
    I try the event-of
        (I am-agent-in the event-of
            (the door open-becomes)).
</pre>which has an abstract description within an abstract description, quite a complex
structure. In English (but not in all other languages), we may also say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    I try the door.
</pre>where it is understood that what I try is actually not the door itself, but the act
of opening it. The same simplification can be done in Lojban, but it must be marked
explicitly using a cmavo. The relevant cmavo is ``tu'a'', which belongs to selma'o LAhE.
The Lojban equivalent of <a href="#e10d3">Example 10.3</a> is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi troci tu'a le vorme
    I try some-action-to-do-with the door.
</pre>The term ``sumti-raising'', as in the title of this section, signifies that a sumti
which logically belongs within an abstraction (or even within an abstraction which is
itself inside an intermediate abstraction) is ``raised'' to the main bridi level. This
transformation from <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a> to <a href="#e10d4">Example
10.4</a> loses information: nothing except convention tells us what the abstraction was.

    <p>Using ``tu'a'' is a kind of laziness: it makes speaking easier at the possible
    expense of clarity for the listener. The speaker must be prepared for the listener to
    respond something like:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    tu'a le vorme lu'u ki'a
    something-to-do-with the door [terminator] [confusion!]
</pre>which indicates that ``tu'a le vorme'' cannot be understood. (The terminator for
``tu'a'' is ``lu'u'', and is used in <a href="#e10d5">Example 10.5</a> to make clear just
what is being questioned: the sumti-raising, rather than the word ``vorme'' as such.) An
example of a confusing raised sumti might be:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    tu'a la djan. cu cafne
    something-to-do-with John frequently-occurs
</pre>

    <p>This must mean that something which John does, or which happens to John, occurs
    frequently: but without more context there is no way to figure out what. Note that
    without the ``tu'a'', <a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a> would mean that John
    considered as an event frequently occurs --- in other words, that John has some sort
    of on-and-off existence! Normally we do not think of people as events in English, but
    the x1 place of ``cafne'' is an event, and if something that does not seem to be an
    event is put there, the Lojbanic listener will attempt to construe it as one. (Of
    course, this analysis assumes that ``djan.'' is the name of a person, and not the
    name of some event.)</p>

    <p>Logically, a counterpart of some sort is needed to ``tu'a'' which transposes an
    abstract sumti into a concrete one. This is achieved at the selbri level by the cmavo
    ``jai'' (of selma'o JAI). This cmavo has more than one function, discussed in
    <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a> and <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>;
    for the purposes of this chapter, it operates as a conversion of selbri, similarly to
    the cmavo of selma'o SE. This conversion changes</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    tu'a mi rinka
        le nu do morsi

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
    I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
    I cause your death.
</pre>

    <p>In English, the subject of ``cause'' can either be the actual cause (an event), or
    else the agent of the cause (a person, typically); not so in Lojban, where the x1 of
    ``rinka'' is always an event. <a href="#e10d7">Example 10.7</a> and <a href=
    "#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> look equally convenient (or inconvenient), but in making
    descriptions, <a href="#e10d8">Example 10.8</a> can be altered to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    le jai rinka
        be le nu do morsi
    that-which-is associated-with causing
        (the event-of your death)
    the one who caused your death
</pre>because ``jai'' modifies the selbri and can be incorporated into the description
--- not so for ``tu'a''.

    <p>The weakness of ``jai'' used in descriptions in this way is that it does not
    specify which argument of the implicit abstraction is being raised into the x1 place
    of the description selbri. One can be more specific by using the modal form of
    ``jai'' explained in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  le jai gau rinka

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s11" name="s11">12. Event-type abstractors and event contour
    tenses</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s11" name="s11">This section is a logical continuation of</a> <a href=
    "#s3">Section 3</a>.</p>

    <p>There exists a relationship between the four types of events explained in <a href=
    "#s3">Section 3</a> and the event contour tense cmavo of selma'o ZAhO. The specific
    cmavo of NU and of ZAhO are mutually interdefining; the ZAhO contours were chosen to
    fit the needs of the NU event types and vice versa. Event contours are explained in
    full in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>, and only summarized here.</p>

    <p>The purpose of ZAhO cmavo is to represent the natural portions of an event, such
    as the beginning, the middle, and the end. They fall into several groups:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>The cmavo ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and ``ba'o'' represent spans of time: before an
      event begins, while it is going on, and after it is over, respectively.</dd>

      <dd>The cmavo ``co'a'', ``de'a'', ``di'a'', and ``co'u'' represent points of time:
      the start of an event, the temporary stopping of an event, the resumption of an
      event after a stop, and the end of an event, respectively. Not all events can have
      breaks in them, in which case ``de'a'' and ``di'a'' do not apply.</dd>

      <dd>The cmavo ``mo'u'' and ``za'o'' correspond to ``co'u'' and ``ba'o''
      respectively, in the case of those events which have a natural ending point that
      may not be the same as the actual ending point: ``mo'u'' refers to the natural
      ending point, and ``za'o'' to the time between the natural ending point and the
      actual ending point (the ``excessive'' or ``superfective'' part of the event).</dd>

      <dd>The cmavo ``co'i'' represents an entire event considered as a point-event or
      achievement.</dd>
    </dl>All these cmavo are applicable to events seen as processes and abstracted with
    ``pu'u''. Only processes have enough internal structure to make all these points and
    spans of time meaningful.

    <p>For events seen as states and abstracted with ``za'i'', the meaningful event
    contours are the spans ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and ``ba'o''; the starting and ending
    points ``co'a'' and ``co'u'', and the achievement contour ``co'i''. States do not
    have natural endings distinct from their actual ending. (It is an open question
    whether states can be stopped and resumed.)</p>

    <p>For events seen as activities and abstracted with ``zu'o'', the meaningful event
    contours are the spans ``pu'o'', ``ca'o'', and ``ba'o'', and the achievement contour
    ``co'i''. Because activities are inherently cyclic and repetitive, the beginning and
    ending points are not well-defined: you do not know whether an activity has truly
    begun until it begins to repeat.</p>

    <p>For events seen as point-events and abstracted with ``mu'e'', the meaningful event
    contours are the spans ``pu'o'' and ``ba'o'' but not ``ca'o'' (a point-event has no
    duration), and the achievement contour ``co'i''.</p>

    <p>Note that the parts of events are themselves events, and may be treated as such.
    The points in time may be seen as ``mu'e'' point-events; the spans of time may
    constitute processes or activities. Therefore, Lojban allows us to express processes
    within processes, activities within states, and many other complicated abstract
    things.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-11-s12" name="s12">An abstractor may be replaced by two or more abstractors

    between two bridi which differ only in abstraction marker. <a href="#e13d1">Example

    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s1" name="s1">1. Why have lujvo?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s1" name="s1">The Lojban vocabulary is founded on its list of 1350-plus
    gismu, made up by combining word lists from various sources. These gismu are not
    intended to be either a complete vocabulary for the language nor a minimal list of
    semantic primitives. Instead, the gismu list serves as a basis for the creation of
    compound words, or lujvo. The intention is that (except in certain semantically broad
    but shallow fields such as cultures, nations, foods, plants, and animals) suitable
    lujvo can be devised to cover the ten million or so concepts expressible in all the
    world's languages taken together. Grammatically, lujvo behave just like gismu: they
    have place structures and function as selbri.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s1" name="s1">There is a close relationship between lujvo and tanru. In
    fact, lujvo are condensed forms of tanru:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  ti fagri festi
    That is-fire waste.
</pre>contains a tanru which can be reduced to the lujvo in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  ti fagyfesti
    That is-fire-waste.
    That is-ashes.
</pre>

    <p>Although the lujvo ``fagyfesti'' is derived from the tanru ``fagri festi'', it is
    not equivalent in meaning to it. In particular, ``fagyfesti'' has a distinct place
    structure of its own, not the same as that of ``festi''. (In contrast, the tanru does
    have the same place structure as ``festi''.) The lujvo needs to take account of the
    places of ``fagri'' as well. When a tanru is made into a lujvo, there is no
    equivalent of ``be ... bei ... be'o'' (described in <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter
    5</a>) to incorporate sumti into the middle of the lujvo.</p>

    <p>So why have lujvo? Primarily to reduce semantic ambiguity. On hearing a tanru,
    there is a burden on the listener to figure out what the tanru might mean. Adding
    further terms to the tanru reduces ambiguity in one sense, by providing more
    information; but it increases ambiguity in another sense, because there are more and
    more tanru joints, each with an ambiguous significance. Since lujvo, like other
    brivla, have a fixed place structure and a single meaning, encapsulating a
    commonly-used tanru into a lujvo relieves the listener of the burden of creative
    understanding. In addition, lujvo are typically shorter than the corresponding
    tanru.</p>

    <p>There are no absolute laws fixing the place structure of a newly created lujvo.
    The maker must consider the place structures of all the components of the tanru and
    then decide which are still relevant and which can be removed. What is said in this
    chapter represents guidelines, presented as one possible standard, not necessarily
    complete, and not the only possible standard. There may well be lujvo that are built
    without regard for these guidelines, or in accordance with entirely different
    guidelines, should such alternative guidelines someday be developed. The reason for
    presenting any guidelines at all is so that Lojbanists have a starting point for
    deciding on a likely place structure --- one that others seeing the same word can
    also arrive at by similar consideration.</p>

    <p>If the tanru includes connective cmavo such as ``bo'', ``ke'', ``ke'e'', or
    ``je'', or conversion or abstraction cmavo such as ``se'' or ``nu'', there are ways
    of incorporating them into the lujvo as well. Sometimes this makes the lujvo
    excessively long; if so, the cmavo may be dropped. This leads to the possibility that
    more than one tanru could produce the same lujvo. Typically, however, only one of the
    possible tanru is useful enough to justify making a lujvo for it.</p>

    <p>The exact workings of the lujvo-making algorithm, which takes a tanru built from
    gismu (and possibly cmavo) and produces a lujvo from it, are described in <a href=

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s2" name="s2">The meaning of a lujvo is controlled by --- but is not the
    same as --- the meaning of the tanru from which the lujvo was constructed. The tanru
    corresponding to a lujvo is called its ``veljvo'' in Lojban, and since there is no
    concise English equivalent, that term will be used in this chapter. Furthermore, the
    left (modifier) part of a tanru will be called the ``seltau'', and the right
    (modified) part the ``tertau'', following the usage of</a> <a href=
    "chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>. For brevity, we will speak of the seltau or tertau of
    a lujvo, meaning of course the seltau or tertau of the veljvo of that lujvo. (If this
    terminology is confusing, substituting ``modifier'' for ``seltau'' and ``modified''
    for ``tertau'' may help.)</p>

    <p>The place structure of a tanru is always the same as the place structure of its
    tertau. As a result, the meaning of the tanru is a modified version of the meaning of
    the tertau; the tanru will typically, but not always, refer to a subset of the things
    referred to by the tertau.</p>

    <p>The purpose of a tanru is to join concepts together without necessarily focusing
    on the exact meaning of the seltau. For example, in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, the poet
    talks about ``the wine-dark sea'', in which ``wine'' is a seltau relative to
    ``dark'', and the pair of words is a seltau relative to ``sea''. We're talking about
    the sea, not about wine or color. The other words are there to paint a scene in the
    listener's mind, in which the real action will occur, and to evoke relations to other
    sagas of the time similarly describing the sea. Logical inferences about wine or
    color will be rejected as irrelevant.</p>

    <p>As a simple example, consider the rather non-obvious tanru ``klama zdani'', or
    ``goer-house''. The gismu ``zdani'' has two places:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  x1 is a nest/house/lair/den for inhabitant x2
</pre>(but in this chapter we will use simply ``house'', for brevity), and the gismu
``klama'' has five:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  x1 goes to destination x2 from origin point x3
        via route x4 using means x5
</pre>

    <p>The tanru ``klama zdani'' will also have two places, namely those of ``zdani''.
    Since a ``klama zdani'' is a type of ``zdani'', we can assume that all goer-houses
    --- whatever they may be --- are also houses.</p>

    <p>But is knowing the places of the tertau everything that is needed to understand
    the meaning of a tanru? No. To see why, let us switch to a less unlikely tanru:
    ``gerku zdani'', literally ``dog house''. A tanru expresses a very loose relation: a
    ``gerku zdani'' is a house that has something to do with some dog or dogs. What the
    precise relation might be is left unstated. Thus, the meaning of ``lo gerku zdani''
    can include all of the following: houses occupied by dogs, houses shaped by dogs,
    dogs which are also houses (e.g. houses for fleas), houses named after dogs, and so
    on. All that is essential is that the place structure of ``zdani'' continues to
    apply.</p>

    <p>For something (call it z1) to qualify as a ``gerku zdani'' in Lojban, it's got to
    be a house, first of all. For it to be a house, it's got to house someone (call that
    z2). Furthermore, there's got to be a dog somewhere (called g1). For g1 to count as a
    dog in Lojban, it's got to belong to some breed as well (called g2). And finally, for
    z1 to be in the first place of ``gerku zdani'', as opposed to just ``zdani'', there's
    got to be some relationship (called r) between some place of ``zdani'' and some place
    of ``gerku''. It doesn't matter which places, because if there's a relationship
    between some place of ``zdani'' and any place of ``gerku'', then that relationship
    can be compounded with the relationship between the places of ``gerku'' --- namely,
    ``gerku'' itself --- to reach any of the other ``gerku'' places. Thus, if the
    relationship turns out to be between z2 and g2, we can still state r in terms of z1
    and g1: ``the relationship involves the dog g1, whose breed has to do with the
    occupant of the house z1''.</p>

    <p>Doubtless to the relief of the reader, here's an illustration. We want to find out
    whether the White House (the one in which the U. S. President lives, that is) counts
    as a ``gerku zdani''. We go through the five variables. The White House is the z1. It
    houses Bill Clinton as z2, as of this writing, so it counts as a ``zdani''. Let's
    take a dog --- say, Spot (g1). Spot has to have a breed; let's say it's a Saint
    Bernard (g2). Now, the White House counts as a ``gerku zdani'' if there is any
    relationship (r) at all between the White House and Spot. (We'll choose the g1 and z1
    places to relate by r; we could have chosen any other pair of places, and simply
    gotten a different relationship.)</p>

    <p>The sky is the limit for r; it can be as complicated as ``The other day, g1 (Spot)
    chased Socks, who is owned by Chelsea Clinton, who is the daughter of Bill Clinton,
    who lives in z1 (the White House)'' or even worse. If no such r can be found, well,
    you take another dog, and keep going until no more dogs can be found. Only then can
    we say that the White House cannot fit into the first place of ``gerku zdani''.</p>

    <p>As we have seen, no less than five elements are involved in the definition of
    ``gerku zdani'': the house, the house dweller, the dog, the dog breed (everywhere a
    dog goes in Lojban, a dog breed follows), and the relationship between the house and
    the dog. Since tanru are explicitly ambiguous in Lojban, the relationship r cannot be
    expressed within a tanru (if it could, it wouldn't be a tanru any more!) All the
    other places, however, can be expressed --- thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  la blabi zdani cu gerku be fa la spot.
        bei la sankt. berNARD. be'o
        zdani la bil. klinton.
    The White House is-a-dog (namely Spot
        of-breed Saint Bernard)
        type-of-house-for Bill Clinton.
</pre>Not the most elegant sentence ever written in either Lojban or English. Yet if
there is any relation at all between Spot and the White House, <a href="#e2d4">Example
2.4</a> is arguably true. If we concentrate on just one type of relation in interpreting
the tanru ``gerku zdani'', then the meaning of ``gerku zdani'' changes. So if we
understand ``gerku zdani'' as having the same meaning as the English word ``doghouse'',
the White House would no longer be a ``gerku zdani'' with respect to Spot, because as far
as we know Spot does not actually live in the White House, and the White House is not a
doghouse (derogatory terms for incumbents notwithstanding).

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">3. The meaning of lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">This is a fairly long way to go to try and work out how to
    say ``doghouse''! The reader can take heart; we're nearly there. Recall that one of
    the components involved in fixing the meaning of a tanru --- the one left
    deliberately vague --- is the precise relation between the tertau and the seltau.
    Indeed, fixing this relation is tantamount to giving an interpretation to the
    ambiguous tanru.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">A lujvo is defined by a single disambiguated instance of a
    tanru. That is to say, when we try to design the place structure of a lujvo, we don't
    need to try to discover the relation between the tertau and the seltau. We already
    know what kind of relation we're looking for; it's given by the specific need we wish
    to express, and it determines the place structure of the lujvo itself.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to simply devise
    lujvo and decide on place structures for them without considering one or more
    specific usages for the coinage. If one does not consider specifics, one will be
    likely to make erroneous generalizations on the relationship r.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">The insight driving the rest of this chapter is this: while
    the relation expressed by a tanru can be very distant (e.g. Spot chasing Socks,
    above), the relationship singled out for disambiguation in a lujvo should be quite
    close. This is because lujvo-making, paralleling natural language compounding, picks
    out the most salient relationship r between a tertau place and a seltau place to be
    expressed in a single word. The relationship ``dog chases cat owned by daughter of
    person living in house'' is too distant, and too incidental, to be likely to need
    expression as a single short word; the relationship ``dog lives in house'' is not.
    From all the various interpretations of ``gerku zdani'', the person creating
    ``gerzda'' should pick the most useful value of r. The most useful one is usually
    going to be the most obvious one, and the most obvious one is usually the closest
    one.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">In fact, the relationship will almost always be so close that
    the predicate expressing r will be either the seltau or the tertau predicate itself.
    This should come as no surprise, given that a word like ``zdani'' in Lojban is a
    predicate. Predicates express relations; so when you're looking for a relation to tie
    together ``le zdani'' and ``le gerku'', the most obvious relation to pick is the very
    relation named by the tertau, ``zdani'': the relation between a home and its dweller.
    As a result, the object which fills the first place of ``gerku'' (the dog) also fills
    the second place of ``zdani'' (the house-dweller).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">The seltau-tertau relationship in the veljvo is expressed by
    the seltau or tertau predicate itself. Therefore, at least one of the seltau places
    is going to be equivalent to a tertau place. This place is thus redundant, and can be
    dropped from the place structure of the lujvo. As a corollary, the precise
    relationship between the veljvo components can be implicitly determined by finding
    one or more places to overlap in this way.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">So what is the place structure of ``gerzda''? We're left with
    three places, since the dweller, the ``se zdani'', turned out to be identical to the
    dog, the ``gerku''. We can proceed as follows:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s3" name="s3">(The notation introduced casually in</a> <a href=
    "#s2">Section 2</a> will be useful in the rest of this chapter. Rather than using the
    regular x1, x2, etc. to represent places, we'll use the first letter of the relevant
    gismu in place of the ``x'', or more than one letter where necessary to resolve
    ambiguities. Thus, z1 is the first place of ``zdani'', and g2 is the second place of
    ``gerku''.)</p>

    <p>The place structure of ``zdani'' is given as <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>, but
    is repeated here using the new notation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  z1 is a nest/house/lair/den of z2
</pre>

    <p>The place structure of ``gerku'' is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  g1 is a dog of breed g2
</pre>

    <p>But z2 is the same as g1; therefore, the tentative place structure for ``gerzda''
    now becomes:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  z1 is a house for dweller z2 of breed g2
</pre>which can also be written
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  z1 is a house for dog g1 of breed g2
</pre>or more concisely
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  z1 is a house for dweller/dog z2=g1 of breed g2
</pre>

    <p>Despite the apparently conclusive nature of <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, our
    task is not yet done: we still need to decide whether any of the remaining places
    should also be eliminated, and what order the lujvo places should appear in. These
    concerns will be addressed in the remainder of the chapter; but we are now equipped
    with the terminology needed for those discussions.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s4" name="s4">4. Selecting places</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s4" name="s4">The set of places of an ordinary lujvo are selected from the
    places of its component gismu. More precisely, the places of such a lujvo are derived
    from the set of places of the component gismu by eliminating unnecessary places,
    until just enough places remain to give an appropriate meaning to the lujvo. In
    general, including a place makes the concept expressed by a lujvo more general;
    excluding a place makes the concept more specific, because omitting the place
    requires assuming a standard value or range of values for it.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s4" name="s4">It would be possible to design the place structure of a lujvo
    from scratch, treating it as if it were a gismu, and working out what arguments
    contribute to the notion to be expressed by the lujvo. There are two reasons arguing
    against doing so and in favor of the procedure detailed in this chapter.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s4" name="s4">The first is that it might be very difficult for a hearer or
    reader, who has no preconceived idea of what concept the lujvo is intended to convey,
    to work out what the place structure actually is. Instead, he or she would have to
    make use of a lujvo dictionary every time a lujvo is encountered in order to work out
    what a ``se jbopli'' or a ``te klagau'' is. But this would mean that, rather than
    having to learn just the 1300-odd gismu place structures, a Lojbanist would also have
    to learn myriads of lujvo place structures with little or no apparent pattern or
    regularity to them. The purpose of the guidelines documented in this chapter is to
    apply regularity and to make it conventional wherever possible.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s4" name="s4">The second reason is related to the first: if the veljvo of
    the lujvo has not been properly selected, and the places for the lujvo are formulated
    from scratch, then there is a risk that some of the places formulated may not
    correspond to any of the places of the gismu used in the veljvo of the lujvo. If that
    is the case --- that is to say, if the lujvo places are not a subset of the veljvo
    gismu places --- then it will be very difficult for the hearer or reader to
    understand what a particular place means, and what it is doing in that particular
    lujvo. This is a topic that will be further discussed in</a> <a href="#s14">Section
    14</a>.</p>

    <p>However, second-guessing the place structure of the lujvo is useful in guiding the
    process of subsequently eliminating places from the veljvo. If the Lojbanist has an
    idea of what the final place structure should look like, he or she should be able to
    pick an appropriate veljvo to begin with, in order to express the idea, and then to
    decide which places are relevant or not relevant to expressing that idea.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s5" name="s5">5. Symmetrical and asymmetrical lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s5" name="s5">A common pattern, perhaps the most common pattern, of
    lujvo-making creates what is called a ``symmetrical lujvo''. A symmetrical lujvo is
    one based on a tanru interpretation such that the first place of the seltau is
    equivalent to the first place of the tertau: each component of the tanru
    characterizes the same object. As an illustration of this, consider the lujvo
    ``balsoi'': it is intended to mean ``both great and a soldier'' --- that is, ``great
    soldier'', which is the interpretation we would tend to give its veljvo, ``banli
    sonci''. The underlying gismu place structures are:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s5" name="s5"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d1" name=
"e5d1">5.1)</a>  ``banli'': b1 is great in property b2 by standard b3
    ``sonci'': s1 is a soldier of army s2
</pre>

    <p>In this case the s1 place of ``sonci'' is redundant, since it is equivalent to the
    b1 place of ``banli''. Therefore the place structure of ``balsoi'' need not include
    places for both s1 and b1, as they refer to the same thing. So the place structure of
    ``balsoi'' is at most</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2
        in property b2 by standard b3
</pre>Some symmetrical veljvo have further equivalent places in addition to the
respective first places. Consider the lujvo ``tinju'i'', ``to listen'' (``to hear
attentively, to hear and pay attention''). The place structures of the gismu ``tirna''
and ``jundi'' are:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d3" name=
"e5d3">5.3)</a>  ``tirna'': t1 listens to t2 against background noise t3
    ``jundi'': j1 pays attention to j2
</pre>and the place structure of the lujvo is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  j1=t1 listens to j2=t2 against background noise t3
</pre>

    <p>Why so? Because not only is the j1 place (the one who pays attention) equivalent
    to the t1 place (the hearer), but the j2 place (the thing paid attention to) is
    equivalent to the t2 place (the thing heard).</p>

    <p>A substantial minority of lujvo have the property that the first place of the
    seltau (``gerku'' in this case) is equivalent to a place other than the first place
    of the tertau; such lujvo are said to be ``asymmetrical''. (There is a deliberate
    parallel here with the terms ``asymmetrical tanru'' and ``symmetrical tanru'' used in
    <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.)</p>

    <p>In principle any asymmetrical lujvo could be expressed as a symmetrical lujvo.
    Consider ``gerzda'', discussed in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a>, where we learned that
    the g1 place was equivalent to the z2 place. In order to get the places aligned, we
    could convert ``zdani'' to ``se zdani'' (or ``selzda'' when expressed as a lujvo).
    The place structure of ``selzda'' is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  s1 is housed by nest s2
</pre>and so the three-part lujvo ``gerselzda'' would have the place structure
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  s1=g1 is a dog housed in nest s2 of dog breed g2
</pre>

    <p>However, although ``gerselzda'' is a valid lujvo, it doesn't translate
    ``doghouse''; its first place is the dog, not the doghouse. Furthermore, it is more
    complicated than necessary; ``gerzda'' is simpler than ``gerselzda''.</p>

    <p>From the reader's or listener's point of view, it may not always be obvious
    whether a newly met lujvo is symmetrical or asymmetrical, and if the latter, what
    kind of asymmetrical lujvo. If the place structure of the lujvo isn't given in a
    dictionary or elsewhere, then plausibility must be applied, just as in interpreting
    tanru.</p>

    <p>The lujvo ``karcykla'', for example, is based on ``karce klama'', or ``car goer''.
    The place structure of ``karce'' is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ka1 is a car carrying ka2 propelled by ka3
</pre>

    <p>A asymmetrical interpretation of ``karcykla'' that is strictly analogous to the
    place structure of ``gerzda'', equating the kl2 (destination) and ka1 (car) places,
    would lead to the place structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  kl1 goes to car kl2=ka1 which carries ka2
        propelled by ka3 from origin kl3
        via route kl4 by means of kl5
</pre>

    <p>But in general we go about in cars, rather than going to cars, so a far more
    likely place structure treats the ka1 place as equivalent to the kl5 place, leading
    to</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  kl1 goes to destination kl2 from origin kl3
        via route kl4 by means of car kl5=ka1
        carrying ka2 propelled by ka3.
</pre>instead.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s6" name="s6">6. Dependent places</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s6" name="s6">In order to understand which places, if any, should be
    completely removed from a lujvo place structure, we need to understand the concept of
    dependent places. One place of a brivla is said to be dependent on another if its
    value can be predicted from the values of one or more of the other places. For
    example, the g2 place of ``gerku'' is dependent on the g1 place. Why? Because when we
    know what fits in the g1 place (Spot, let us say, a well-known dog), then we know
    what fits in the g2 place (``St. Bernard'', let us say). In other words, when the
    value of the g1 place has been specified, the value of the g2 place is determined by
    it. Conversely, since each dog has only one breed, but each breed contains many dogs,
    the g1 place is not dependent on the g2 place; if we know only that some dog is a St.
    Bernard, we cannot tell by that fact alone which dog is meant.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s6" name="s6">For ``zdani'', on the other hand, there is no dependency
    between the places. When we know the identity of a house-dweller, we have not
    determined the house, because a dweller may dwell in more than one house. By the same
    token, when we know the identity of a house, we do not know the identity of its
    dweller, for a house may contain more than one dweller.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s6" name="s6">The rule for eliminating places from a lujvo is that
    dependent places provided by the seltau are eliminated. Therefore, in ``gerzda'' the
    dependent g2 place is removed from the tentative place structure given in</a>
    <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, leaving the place structure:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  z1 is the house dwelt in by dog z2=g1
</pre>

    <p>Informally put, the reason this has happened --- and it happens a lot with seltau
    places --- is that the third place was describing not the doghouse, but the dog who
    lives in it. The sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la mon. rePOS. gerzda la spat.
    Mon Repos is a doghouse of Spot.
</pre>really means
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  la mon. rePOS. zdani la spat. noi gerku
    Mon Repos is a house of Spot, who is a dog.
</pre>since that is the interpretation we have given ``gerzda''. But that in turn means

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  la mon. rePOS. zdani la spat noi ke'a gerku zo'e

</pre>employing the over-ample place structure of <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>. The
dog breed is redundantly given both in the main selbri and in the relative clause, and
(intuitively speaking) is repeated in the wrong place, since the dog breed is
supplementary information about the dog, and not about the doghouse.

    <p>As a further example, take ``cakcinki'', the lujvo for ``beetle'', based on the
    tanru ``calku cinki'', or ``shell-insect''. The gismu place structures are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  ``calku'': ca1 is a shell/husk around ca2 made of ca3
    ``cinki'': ci1 is an insect/arthropod of species ci2
</pre>This example illustrates a cross-dependency between a place of one gismu and a
place of the other. The ca3 place is dependent on ci1, because all insects (which fit
into ci1) have shells made of chitin (which fits into ca3). Furthermore, ca1 is dependent
on ci1 as well, because each insect has only a single shell. And since ca2 (the thing
with the shell) is equivalent to ci1 (the insect), the place structure is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  ci1=ca2 is a beetle of species ci2
</pre>with not a single place of ``calku'' surviving independently!

    <p>(Note that there is nothing in this explanation that tells us just why
    ``cakcinki'' means ``beetle'' (member of Coleoptera), since all insects in their
    adult forms have chitin shells of some sort. The answer, which is in no way
    predictable, is that the shell is a prominent, highly noticeable feature of beetles
    in particular.)</p>

    <p>What about the dependency of ci2 on ci1? After all, no beetle belongs to more than
    one species, so it would seem that the ci2 place of ``cakcinki'' could be eliminated
    on the same reasoning that allowed us to eliminate the g2 place of ``gerzda'' above.
    However, it is a rule that dependent places are not eliminated from a lujvo when they
    are derived from the tertau of its veljvo. This rule is imposed to keep the place
    structures of lujvo from drifting too far from the tertau place structure; if a place
    is necessary in the tertau, it's treated as necessary in the lujvo as well.</p>

    <p>In general, the desire to remove places coming from the tertau is a sign that the
    veljvo selected is simply wrong. Different place structures imply different concepts,
    and the lujvo maker may be trying to shoehorn the wrong concept into the place
    structure of his or her choosing. This is obvious when someone tries to shoe-horn a
    ``klama'' tertau into a ``litru'' or ``cliva'' concept, for example: these gismu
    differ in their number of arguments, and suppressing places of ``klama'' in a lujvo
    doesn't make any sense if the resulting modified place structure is that of ``litru''
    or ``cliva''.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the dependency is between a single place of the tertau and the whole
    event described by the seltau. Such cases are discussed further in <a href=
    "#s13">Section 13</a>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, not all dependent places in the seltau can be safely removed: some
    of them are necessary to interpreting the lujvo's meaning in context. It doesn't
    matter much to a doghouse what breed of dog inhabits it, but it can make quite a lot
    of difference to the construction of a school building what kind of school is in it!
    Music schools need auditoriums and recital rooms, elementary schools need
    playgrounds, and so on: therefore, the place structure of ``kuldi'u'' (from ``ckule
    dinju'', and meaning ``school building'') needs to be</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>  d1 is a building housing school c1
        teaching subject c3 to audience c4
</pre>even though c3 and c4 are plainly dependent on c1. The other places of ``ckule'',
the location (c2) and operators (c5), don't seem to be necessary to the concept ``school
building'', and are dependent on c1 to boot, so they are omitted. Again, the need for
case-by-case consideration of place structures is demonstrated.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s7" name="s7">7. Ordering lujvo places.</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s7" name="s7">So far, we have concentrated on selecting the places to go
    into the place structure of a lujvo. However, this is only half the story. In using
    selbri in Lojban, it is important to remember the right order of the sumti. With
    lujvo, the need to attend to the order of sumti becomes critical: the set of places
    selected should be ordered in such a way that a reader unfamiliar with the lujvo
    should be able to tell which place is which.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s7" name="s7">If we aim to make understandable lujvo, then, we should make
    the order of places in the place structure follow some conventions. If this does not
    occur, very real ambiguities can turn up. Take for example the lujvo ``jdaselsku'',
    meaning ``prayer''. In the sentence</a></p>

    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  This is a prayer to Dong
</pre>

    <p>We could resolve such problems on a case-by-case basis for each lujvo (<a href=
    "#s14">Section 14</a> discusses when this is actually necessary), but case-by-case
    resolution for run-of-the-mill lujvo makes the task of learning lujvo place
    structures unmanageable. People need consistent patterns to make sense of what they
    learn. Such patterns can be found across gismu place structures (see <a href=
    "#s16">Section 16</a>), and are even more necessary in lujvo place structures.
    Case-by-case consideration is still necessary; lujvo creation is a subtle art, after
    all. But it is helpful to take advantage of any available regularities.</p>

    <p>We use two different ordering rules: one for symmetrical lujvo and one for
    asymmetrical ones. A symmetrical lujvo like ``balsoi'' (from <a href="#s5">Section
    5</a>) has the places of its tertau followed by whatever places of the seltau survive
    the elimination process. For ``balsoi'', the surviving places of ``banli'' are b2 and
    b3, leading to the place structure:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  b1=s1 is a great soldier of army s2
        in property b2 by standard b3
</pre>just what appears in <a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a>. In fact, all place structures
shown until now have been in the correct order by the conventions of this section, though
the fact has been left tacit until now.

    <p>The motivation for this rule is the parallelism between the lujvo bridi-schema</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  b1 bansoi s2 b2 b3
    b1 is-a-great-soldier of-army-s2
        in-property-b2 by-standard-b3
</pre>and the more or less equivalent bridi-schema
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  b1 sonci s2 gi'e banli b2 b3
    b1 is-a-soldier of-army-s2 and
        is-great in-property-b2
        by-standard-b3
</pre>where ``gi'e'' is the Lojban word for ``and'' when placed between two partial
bridi, as explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>.

    <p>Asymmetrical lujvo like ``gerzda'', on the other hand, employ a different rule.
    The seltau places are inserted not at the end of the place structure, but rather
    immediately after the tertau place which is equivalent to the first place of the
    seltau. Consider ``dalmikce'', meaning ``veterinarian'': its veljvo is ``danlu
    mikce'', or ``animal doctor''. The place structures for those gismu are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  ``danlu'': d1 is an animal of species d2
    ``mikce'': m1 is a doctor to patient m2 for ailment m3
        using treatment m4
</pre>and the lujvo place structure is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  m1 is a doctor for animal m2=d1 of species d2
        for ailment m3 using treatment m4
</pre>Since the shared place is m2=d1, the animal patient, the remaining seltau place d2
is inserted immediately after the shared place; then the remaining tertau places form the
last two places of the lujvo.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s8" name="s8">8. lujvo with more than two parts.</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s8" name="s8">The theory we have outlined so far is an account of lujvo
    with two parts. But often lujvo are made containing more than two parts. An example
    is ``bavlamdei'', ``tomorrow'': it is composed of the rafsi for ``future'',
    ``adjacent'', and ``day''. How does the account we have given apply to lujvo like
    this?</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s8" name="s8">The best way to approach such lujvo is to continue to
    classify them as based on binary tanru, the only difference being that the seltau or
    the tertau or both is itself a lujvo. So it is easiest to make sense of ``bavlamdei''
    as having two components: ``bavla'i'', ``next'', and ``djedi''. If we know or invent
    the lujvo place structure for the components, we can compose the new lujvo place
    structure in the usual way.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s8" name="s8">In this case, ``bavla'i'' is given the place
    structure</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s8" name="s8"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  b1=l1 is next after b2=l2
</pre>making it a symmetrical lujvo. We combine this with ``djedi'', which has the place
structure:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  duration d1 is d2 days long (default 1)
        by standard d3
</pre>While symmetrical lujvo normally put any trailing tertau places before any seltau
places, the day standard is a much less important concept than the day the tomorrow
follows, in the definition of ``bavlamdei''. This is an example of how the guidelines
presented for selecting and ordering lujvo places are just that, not laws that must be
rigidly adhered to. In this case, we choose to rank places in order of relative
importance. The resulting place structure is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  d1=b1=l1 is a day following b2=l2,
        d2 days later (default 1) by standard d3
</pre>Here is another example of a multi-part lujvo: ``cladakyxa'i'', meaning
``long-sword'', a specific type of medieval weapon. The gismu place structures are:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  ``clani'': c1 is long in direction c2 by standard c3
    ``dakfu'': d1 is a knife for cutting d2
        with blade made of d3
    ``xarci'': xa1 is a weapon for use against xa2
        by wielder xa3
</pre>Since ``cladakyxa'i'' is a symmetrical lujvo based on ``cladakfu xarci'', and
``cladakfu'' is itself a symmetrical lujvo, we can do the necessary analyses all at once.
Plainly c1 (the long thing), d1 (the knife), and xa1 (the weapon) are all the same.
Likewise, the d2 place (the thing cut) is the same as the xa2 place (the target of the
weapon), given that swords are used to cut victims. Finally, the c2 place (direction of
length) is always along the sword blade in a longsword, by definition, and so is
dependent on c1=d1=xa1. Adding on the places of the remaining gismu in right-to-left
order we get:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  xa1=d1=c1 is a long-sword for use against xa2=d2
        by wielder xa3, with a blade made of d3,
        long measured by standard c3.
</pre>

    <p>If the last place sounds unimportant to you, notice that what counts legally as a
    ``sword'', rather than just a ``knife'', depends on the length of the blade (the
    cutoff point varies in different jurisdictions). This fifth place of ``cladakyxa'i''
    may not often be explicitly filled, but it is still useful on occasion. Because it is
    so seldom important, it is best that it be last.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s9" name="s9">9. Eliding SE rafsi from seltau</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s9" name="s9">It is common to form lujvo that omit the rafsi based on cmavo
    of selma'o SE, as well as other cmavo rafsi. Doing so makes lujvo construction for

    has not heard the lujvo before, the shortness of the word should not necessarily
    outweigh ease in understanding, especially if the lujvo refers to a rare or unusual
    concept.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s9" name="s9">Consider as an example the lujvo ``ti'ifla'', from the veljvo
    ``stidi flalu'', and meaning ``bill, proposed law''. The gismu place structures

        to audience st3
    ``flalu'': f1 is a law specifying f2 for community f3
        under conditions f4 by lawgiver f5
</pre>This lujvo does not fit any of our existing molds: it is the second seltau place,
st2, that is equivalent to one of the tertau places, namely f1. However, if we understand
``ti'ifla'' as an abbreviation for the lujvo ``selti'ifla'', then we get the first places
of seltau and tertau lined up. The place structure of ``selti'i'' is:

    <dl>
      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a> ``selti'i'': idea/action se1 is suggested by
      agent se2 to audience se3</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Here we can see that se1 (what is suggested) is equivalent to f1 (the law), and we
    get a normal symmetrical lujvo. The final place structure is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  f1=se1 is a bill specifying f2 for community f3
        under conditions f4 by suggester se2
        to audience/lawgivers f5=se3
</pre>or, relabeling the places,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  f1=st2 is a bill specifying f2 for community f3
        under conditions f4 by suggester st1
        to audience/lawgivers f5=st3
</pre>where the last place (st3) is probably some sort of legislature.

    <p>Abbreviated lujvo like ``ti'ifla'' are more intuitive (for the lujvo-maker) than
    their more explicit counterparts like ``selti'ifla'' (as well as shorter). They don't
    require the coiner to sit down and work out the precise relation between the seltau
    and the tertau: he or she can just rattle off a rafsi pair. But should the lujvo get
    to the stage where a place structure needs to be worked out, then the precise
    relation does need to be specified. And in that case, such abbreviated lujvo form a
    trap in lujvo place ordering, since they obscure the most straightforward relation
    between the seltau and tertau. To give our lujvo-making guidelines as wide an
    application as possible, and to encourage analyzing the seltau-tertau relation in
    lujvo, lujvo like ``ti'ifla'' are given the place structure they would have with the
    appropriate SE added to the seltau.</p>

    <p>Note that, with these lujvo, an interpretation requiring SE insertion is safe only
    if the alternatives are either implausible or unlikely to be needed as a lujvo. This
    may not always be the case, and Lojbanists should be aware of the risk of
    ambiguity.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s10" name="s10">10. Eliding SE rafsi from tertau</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s10" name="s10">Eliding SE rafsi from tertau gets us into much more
    trouble. To understand why, recall that lujvo, following their veljvo, describe some
    type of whatever their tertau describe. Thus, ``posydji'' describes a type of
    ``djica'', ``gerzda'' describes a type of ``zdani'', and so on. What is certain is
    that ``gerzda'' does not describe a ``se zdani'' --- it is not a word that could be
    used to describe an inhabitant such as a dog.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s10" name="s10">Now consider how we would translate the word ``blue-eyed''.

    Jack is-the-bearer-of-blue-eyes

    <p>But look now at the place structure of ``blakanla'': it is a symmetrical lujvo, so
    the place structure is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    xe1=s1 is a blue eye of xe2=s2
</pre>

    <p>We end up being most interested in talking about the second place, not the first
    (we talk much more of people than of their eyes), so ``se'' would almost always be
    required.</p>

    <p>What is happening here is that we are translating the tertau wrongly, under the
    influence of English. The English suffix ``-eyed'' does not mean ``eye'', but someone
    with an eye, which is ``selkanla''.</p>

    <p>Because we've got the wrong tertau (eliding a ``se'' that really should be there),
    any attempt to accommodate the resulting lujvo into our guidelines for place
    structure is fitting a square peg in a round hole. Since they can be so misleading,
    lujvo with SE rafsi elided from the tertau should be avoided in favor of their more
    explicit counterparts: in this case, ``blaselkanla''.</p>

it is criminal to be inside --- an interpretation almost identical with <a href="#e11d3">
    Example 11.3</a> anyway?)

    <p>There are cases, however, where omitting a KE or KEhE rafsi can produce another
    lujvo, equally useful. For example, ``xaskemcakcurnu'' means ``oceanic shellfish'',
    and has the veljvo</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    xamsi ke calku curnu

    (ocean shell) type-of worm
</pre>and might refer to the parasitic worms that infest clamshells.

    <p>Such misinterpretation is more likely than not in a lujvo starting with ``sel-''
    (from ``se''), ``nal-'' (from ``na'e'') or ``tol-'' (from ``to'e''): the scope of the
    rafsi will likeliest be presumed to be as narrow as possible, since all of these
    cmavo normally bind only to the following brivla or ``ke ... ke'e'' group. For that
    reason, if we want to modify an entire lujvo by putting ``se'', ``na'e'' or ``to'e''
    before it, it's better to leave the result as two words, or else to insert ``ke'',
    than to just stick the SE or NAhE rafsi on.</p>

    <p>It is all right to replace the phrase ``se klama'' with ``selkla'', and the places
    of ``selkla'' are exactly those of ``se klama''. But consider the related lujvo
    ``dzukla'', meaning ``to walk to somewhere''. It is a symmmetrical lujvo, derived
    from the veljvo ``cadzu klama'' as follows:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a>    ``cadzu'': c1 walks on surface c2 using limbs c3
    ``klama'': k1 goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 using k5
    ``dzukla'': c1=k1 walks to k2 from k3 via route k4
        using limbs k5=c3 on surface c2
</pre>

    <p>We can swap the k1 and k2 places using ``se dzukla'', but we cannot directly make
    ``se dzukla'' into ``seldzukla'', which would represent the veljvo ``selcadzu klama''
    and plausibly mean something like ``to go to a walking surface''. Instead, we would
    need ``selkemdzukla'', with an explicit rafsi for ``ke''. Similarly, ``nalbrablo''
    (from ``na'e barda bloti'') means ``non-big boat'', whereas ``na'e brablo'' means
    ``other than a big boat''.</p>

    <p>If the lujvo we want to modify with SE has a seltau already starting with a SE
    rafsi, we can take a shortcut. For instance, ``gekmau'' means ``happier than'', while
    ``selgekmau'' means ``making people happier than, more enjoyable than, more of a 'se
    gleki' than''. If something is less enjoyable than something else, we can say it is
    ``se selgekmau''.</p>

    <p>But we can also say it is ``selselgekmau''. Two ``se'' cmavo in a row cancel each
    other (``se se gleki'' means the same as just ``gleki''), so there would be no good
    reason to have ``selsel'' in a lujvo with that meaning. Instead, we can feel free to
    interpret ``selsel-'' as ``selkemsel-''. The rafsi combinations ``terter-'',
    ``velvel-'' and ``xelxel-'' work in the same way.</p>

    <p>Other SE combinations like ``selter-'', although they might conceivably mean ``se
    te'', more than likely should be interpreted in the same way, namely as ``se ke te'',
    since there is no need to re-order places in the way that ``se te'' provides. (See
    <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s12" name="s12">12. Abstract lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s12" name="s12">The cmavo of NU can participate in the construction of
    lujvo of a particularly simple and well-patterned kind. Consider that old standard
    example, ``klama'':</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s12" name="s12"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d1" name=
"e12d1">12.1)</a>    k1 comes/goes to k2 from k3 via route k4 by means k5.
</pre>

    <p>The selbri ``nu klama [kei]'' has only one place, the event-of-going, but the full
    five places exist implicitly between ``nu'' and ``kei'', since a full bridi with all
    sumti may be placed there. In a lujvo, there is no room for such inside places, and
    consequently the lujvo ``nunkla'' (``nun-'' is the rafsi for ``nu''), needs to have
    six places:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d2" name=
"e12d2">12.2)</a>    nu1 is the event of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3
        via route k4 by means k5.
</pre>

    <p>Here the first place of ``nunklama'' is the first and only place of ``nu'', and
    the other five places have been pushed down by one to occupy the second through the
    sixth places. Full information on ``nu'', as well as the other abstractors mentioned
    in this section, is given in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>.</p>

    <p>For those abstractors which have a second place as well, the standard convention
    is to place this place after, rather than before, the places of the brivla being
    abstracted. The place structure of ``nilkla'', the lujvo derived from ``ni klama'',
    is the imposing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d3" name=
"e12d3">12.3)</a>    ni1 is the amount of k1's coming/going to k2 from k3
        via route k4 by means k5, measured on scale ni2.
</pre>

    <p>It is not uncommon for abstractors to participate in the making of more complex
    lujvo as well. For example, ``nunsoidji'', from the veljvo</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    nu sonci kei djica
    event-of being-a-soldier desirer
</pre>has the place structure
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d5" name=
"e12d5">12.5)</a>    d1 desires the event of (s1 being a soldier of army s2)
        for purpose d3
</pre>where the d2 place has disappeared altogether, being replaced by the places of the
seltau. As shown in <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>, the ordering follows this idea of
replacement: the seltau places are inserted at the point where the omitted abstraction
place exists in the tertau.

    <p>The lujvo ``nunsoidji'' is quite different from the ordinary asymmetric lujvo
    ``soidji'', a ``soldier desirer'', whose place structure is just</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    d1 desires (a soldier of army s2) for purpose d3
</pre>

    <p>A ``nunsoidji'' might be someone who is about to enlist, whereas a ``soidji''
    might be a camp-follower.</p>

    <p>One use of abstract lujvo is to eliminate the need for explicit ``kei'' in tanru:
    ``nunkalri gasnu'' means much the same as ``nu kalri kei gasnu'', but is shorter. In
    addition, many English words ending in ``-hood'' are represented with ``nun-'' lujvo,
    and other words ending in ``-ness'' or ``-dom'' are often representable with ``kam-''
    lujvo (``kam-'' is the rafsi for ``ka''); ``kambla'' is ``blueness''.</p>

    <p>Even though the cmavo of NU are long-scope in nature, governing the whole
    following bridi, the NU rafsi should generally be used as short-scope modifiers, like
    the SE and NAhE rafsi discussed in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>.</p>

    <p>There is also a rafsi for the cmavo ``jai'', namely ``jax'', which allows
    sentences like</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    mi jai rinka le nu do morsi
    I am-associated-with causing the event-of your death.
    I cause your death.
</pre>explained in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>, to be rendered with lujvo:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e12d8" name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    mi jaxri'a le nu do morsi
    I am-part-of-the-cause-of the event-of your dying.
</pre>In making a lujvo that contains ``jax-'' for a selbri that contains ``jai'', the
rule is to leave the ``fai'' place as a ``fai'' place of the lujvo; it does not
participate in the regular lujvo place structure. (The use of ``fai'' is also explained
in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>.)

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s13" name="s13">13. Implicit-abstraction lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s13" name="s13">Eliding NU rafsi involves the same restrictions as eliding
    SE rafsi, plus additional ones. In general, NU rafsi should not be elided from the
    tertau, since that changes the kind of thing the lujvo is talking about from an
    abstraction to a concrete sumti. However, they may be elided from the seltau if no
    reasonable ambiguity would result.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s13" name="s13">A major difference, however, between SE elision and NU
    elision is that the former is a rather sparse process, providing a few convenient
    shortenings. Eliding ``nu'', however, is extremely important in producing a class of
    lujvo called ``implicit-abstraction lujvo''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s13" name="s13">Let us make a detailed analysis of the lujvo
    ``nunctikezgau'', meaning ``to feed''. (If you think this lujvo is excessively
    longwinded, be patient.) The veljvo of ``nunctikezgau'' is ``nu citka kei gasnu''.
    The relevant place structures are:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s13" name="s13"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    ``nu'': n1 is an event
    ``citka'': c1 eats c2
    ``gasnu'': g1 does action/is the agent of event g2
</pre>

    <p>In accordance with the procedure for analyzing three-part lujvo given in <a href=
    "#s8">Section 8</a>, we will first create an intermediate lujvo, ``nuncti'', whose
    veljvo is ``nu citka [kei]''. By the rules given in <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>,
    ``nuncti'' has the place structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    n1 is the event of c1 eating c2
</pre>Now we can transform the veljvo of ``nunctikezgau'' into ``nuncti gasnu''. The g2
place (what is brought about by the actor g1) obviously denotes the same thing as n1 (the
event of eating). So we can eliminate g2 as redundant, leaving us with a tentative place
structure of
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d3" name=
"e13d3">13.3)</a>    g1 is the actor in the event n1=g2 of c1 eating c2
</pre>

    <p>But it is also possible to omit the n1 place itself! The n1 place describes the
    event brought about; an event in Lojban is described as a bridi, by a selbri and its
    sumti; the selbri is already known (it's the seltau), and the sumti are also already
    known (they're in the lujvo place structure). So n1 would not give us any information
    we didn't already know. In fact, the n1=g2 place is dependent on c1 and c2 jointly
    --- it does not depend on either c1 or c2 by itself. Being dependent and derived from
    the seltau, it is omissible. So the final place structure of ``nunctikezgau'' is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d4" name="e13d4">13.4)</a>    g1 is the actor in the event of c1 eating c2
</pre>There is one further step that can be taken. As we have already seen with
``balsoi'' in <a href="#s5">Section 5</a>, the interpretation of lujvo is constrained by
the semantics of gismu and of their sumti places. Now, any asymmetrical lujvo with
``gasnu'' as its tertau will involve an event abstraction either implicitly or
explicitly, since that is how the g2 place of ``gasnu'' is defined.

    <p>Therefore, if we assume that ``nu'' is the type of abstraction one would expect to
    be a ``se gasnu'', then the rafsi ``nun'' and ``kez'' in ``nunctikezgau'' are only
    telling us what we would already have guessed --- that the seltau of a ``gasnu''
    lujvo is an event. If we drop these rafsi out, and use instead the shorter lujvo
    ``ctigau'', rejecting its symmetrical interpretation (``someone who both does and
    eats''; ``an eating doer''), we can still deduce that the seltau refers to an
    event.</p>

    <p>(You can't ``do an eater''/``gasnu lo citka'', with the meaning of ``do'' as
    ``bring about an event''; so the seltau must refer to an event, ``nu citka''. The
    English slang meanings of ``do someone'', namely ``socialize with someone'' and
    ``have sex with someone'', are not relevant to ``gasnu''.)</p>

    <p>So we can simply use ``ctigau'' with the same place structure as
    ``nunctikezgau'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d5" name="e13d5">13.5)</a>    agent g1 causes c1 to eat c2
    g1 feeds c2 to c1.
</pre>This particular kind of asymmetrical lujvo, in which the seltau serves as the
selbri of an abstraction which is a place of the tertau, is called an
implicit-abstraction lujvo, because one deduces the presence of an abstraction which is
unexpressed (implicit).

    <p>To give another example: the gismu ``basti'', whose place structure is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    b1 replaces b2 in circumstances b3
</pre>can form the lujvo ``basygau'', with the place structure:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d7" name=
"e13d7">13.7)</a>    g1 (agent) replaces b1 with b2 in circumstances b3
</pre>where both ``basti'' and ``basygau'' are translated ``replace'' in English, but
represent different relations: ``basti'' may be used with no mention of any agent doing
the replacing.

    <p>In addition, ``gasnu''-based lujvo can be built from what we would consider nouns
    or adjectives in English. In Lojban, everything is a predicate, so adjectives, nouns
    and verbs are all treated in the same way. This is consistent with the use of similar
    causative affixes in other languages. For example, the gismu ``litki'', meaning
    ``liquid'', with the place structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a>    l1 is a quantity of liquid of composition l2
        under conditions l3
</pre>can give ``likygau'', meaning ``to liquefy'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d9" name="e13d9">13.9)</a>    g1 (agent) causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid
        of composition l2 under conditions l3.
</pre>

    <p>While ``likygau'' correctly represents ``causes to be a liquid'', a different
    lujvo based on ``galfi'' (meaning ``modify'') may be more appropriate for ``causes to
    become a liquid''. On the other hand, ``fetsygau'' is unsafe, because it could mean
    ``agent in the event of something becoming female'' (the implicit-abstraction
    interpretation) or simply ``female agent'' (the parallel interpretation), so using
    implicit-abstraction lujvo is always accompanied with some risk of being
    misunderstood.</p>

    <p>Many other Lojban gismu have places for event abstractions, and therefore are good
    candidates for the tertau of an implicit-abstraction lujvo. For example, lujvo based
    on ``rinka'', with its place structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d10" name="e13d10">13.10)</a>  event r1 causes event r2 to occur
</pre>are closely related to those based on ``gasnu''. However, ``rinka'' is less
generally useful than ``gasnu'', because its r1 place is another event rather than a
person: ``lo rinka'' is a cause, not a causer. Thus the place structure of ``likyri'a'',
a lujvo analogous to ``likygau'', is
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e13d11" name="e13d11">13.11)</a>  event r1 causes l1 to be a quantity of liquid
        of composition l2 under conditions l3
</pre>and would be useful in translating sentences like ``The heat of the sun liquefied
the block of ice.''

    <p>Implicit-abstraction lujvo are a powerful means in the language of rendering quite
    verbose bridi into succinct and manageable concepts, and increasing the expressive
    power of the language.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s14" name="s14">14. Anomalous lujvo</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s14" name="s14">Some lujvo that have been coined and actually employed in
    Lojban writing do not follow the guidelines expressed above, either because the
    places that are equivalent in the seltau and the tertau are in an unusual position,
    or because the seltau and tertau are related in a complex way, or both. An example of
    the first kind is ``jdaselsku'', meaning ``prayer'', which was mentioned in</a>
    <a href="#s7">Section 7</a>. The gismu places are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d1" name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    ``lijda'': l1 is a religion with believers l2
        and beliefs l3
    ``cusku'': c1 expresses text c2 to audience c3
        in medium c4
</pre>and ``selsku'', the tertau of ``jdaselsku'', has the place structure
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    s1 is a text expressed by s2 to audience s3
        in medium s4
    
Now it is easy to see that the l2 and s2 places are equivalent:  the
believer in the religion (l2) is the one who expresses the prayer (s2).
This is not one of the cases for which a place ordering rule has been
given in <a href="#s7">Section 7</a> or <a href=
"#s13">Section 13</a>; therefore, for lack of a better rule,
we put the tertau places first and the remaining seltau places after them,
leading to the place structure:

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d3" name="e14d3">14.3)</a> s1 is a prayer expressed by s2=l2 to audience s3
        in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1
</pre>

    <p>The l3 place (the beliefs of the religion) is dependent on the l1 place (the
    religion) and so is omitted.</p>

    <p>We could make this lujvo less messy by replacing it with ``se seljdasku'', where
    ``seljdasku'' is a normal symmetrical lujvo with place structure:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d4" name="e14d4">14.4)</a>    c1=l2 religiously expresses
        prayer c2 to audience c3
        in medium s4 pertaining to religion l1
</pre>which, according to the rule expressed in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>, can be
further expressed as ``selseljdasku''. However, there is no need for the ugly ``selsel-''
prefix just to get the rules right: ``jdaselsku'' is a reasonable, if anomalous, lujvo.

    <p>However, there is a further problem with ``jdaselsku'', not resolvable by using
    ``seljdasku''. No veljvo involving just the two gismu ``lijda'' and ``cusku'' can
    fully express the relationship implicit in prayer. A prayer is not just anything said
    by the adherents of a religion; nor is it even anything said by them acting as
    adherents of that religion. Rather, it is what they say under the authority of that
    religion, or using the religion as a medium, or following the rules associated with
    the religion, or something of the kind. So the veljvo is somewhat elliptical.</p>

    <p>As a result, both ``seljdasku'' and ``jdaselsku'' belong to the second class of
    anomalous lujvo: the veljvo doesn't really supply all that the lujvo requires.</p>

    <p>Another example of this kind of anomalous lujvo, drawn from the tanru lists in
    <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>, is ``lange'u'', meaning ``sheepdog''. Clearly
    a sheepdog is not a dog which is a sheep (the symmetrical interpretation is wrong),
    nor a dog of the sheep breed (the asymmetrical interpretation is wrong). Indeed,
    there is simply no overlap in the places of ``lanme'' and ``gerku'' at all. Rather,
    the lujvo refers to a dog which controls sheep flocks, a ``terlanme jitro gerku'',
    the lujvo from which is ``terlantroge'u'' with place structure:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d5" name="e14d5">14.5)</a>    g1=j1 is a dog that controls sheep flock l3=j2
        made up of sheep l1 in activity j3 of dog breed g2
</pre>based on the gismu place structures
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d6" name=
"e14d6">14.6)</a>    ``lanme'': l1 is a sheep of breed l2 belonging to flock l3
    ``gerku'': g1 is a dog of breed g2
    ``jitro'': j1 controls j2 in activity j3
</pre>

    <p>Note that this lujvo is symmetrical between ``lantro'' (sheep-controller) and
    ``gerku'', but ``lantro'' is itself an asymmetrical lujvo. The l2 place, the breed of
    sheep, is removed as dependent on l1. However, the lujvo ``lange'u'' is both shorter
    than ``terlantroge'u'' and sufficiently clear to warrant its use: its place
    structure, however, should be the same as that of the longer lujvo, for which
    ``lange'u'' can be understood as an abbreviation.</p>

    <p>Another example is ``xanmi'e'', ``to command by hand, to beckon''. The component
    place structures are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d7" name="e14d7">14.7)</a>    ``xance'': xa1 is the hand of xa2
    ``minde'': m1 gives commands to m2 to cause m3 to happen
</pre>

    <p>The relation between the seltau and tertau is close enough for there to be an
    overlap: xa2 (the person with the hand) is the same as m1 (the one who commands). But
    interpreting ``xanmi'e'' as a symmetrical lujvo with an elided ``sel-'' in the
    seltau, as if from ``se xance mindu'', misses the point: the real relation expressed
    by the lujvo is not just ``one who commands and has a hand'', but ``to command using
    the hand''. The concept of ``using'' suggests in the gismu ``pilno'', with place
    structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d8" name="e14d8">14.8)</a>    p1 uses tool p2 for purpose p3
</pre>

    <p>Some possible three-part veljvo are (depending on how strictly you want to
    constrain the veljvo)</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d9" name="e14d9">14.9)</a>    [ke] xance pilno [ke'e] minde
    (hand user) type-of commander

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d10" name="e14d10">14.10)</a>   [ke] minde xance [ke'e] pilno
    (commander hand) type-of user
</pre>or even
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e14d11" name="e14d11">14.11)</a>  minde ke xance pilno [ke'e]
    commander type-of (hand user)
</pre>which lead to the three different lujvo ``xanplimi'e'', ``mi'erxanpli'', and
``minkemxanpli'' respectively.

    <p>Does this make ``xanmi'e'' wrong? By no means. But it does mean that there is a
    latent component to the meaning of ``xanmi'e'', the gismu ``pilno'', which is not
    explicit in the veljvo. And it also means that, for a place structure derivation that
    actually makes sense, rather than being ad-hoc, the Lojbanist should probably go
    through a derivation for ``xancypliminde'' or one of the other possibilities that is
    analogous to the analysis of ``terlantroge'u'' above, even if he or she decides to
    stick with a shorter, more convenient form like ``xanmi'e''. In addition, of course,
    the possibilities of elliptical lujvo increase their potential ambiguity enormously
    --- an unavoidable fact which should be borne in mind.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s15" name="s15">15. Comparatives and superlatives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s15" name="s15">English has the concepts of ``comparative adjectives'' and
    ``superlative adjectives'' which can be formed from other adjectives, either by
    adding the suffixes ``-er'' and ``-est'' or by using the words ``more'' and ``most'',

    with the tertau ``zmadu'', ``mleca'', ``zenba'', ``jdika'', and ``traji''. In order
    to make these lujvo regular and easy to make, certain special guidelines are
    imposed.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s15" name="s15">We will begin with lujvo based on ``zmadu'' and ``mleca'',

    ``mleca'': m1 is less than m2 in property m3

    <p>For example, the concept ``young'' is expressed by the gismu ``citno'', with place
    structure</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d2" name="e15d2">15.2)</a>    ``citno'':  c1 is young
</pre>The comparative concept ``younger'' can be expressed by the lujvo ``citmau'' (based
on the veljvo ``citno zmadu'', meaning ``young more-than'').
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d3" name="e15d3">15.3)</a>    mi citmau do lo nanca be li xa

    You are-less-young-than me by-years the-number six.
    You are six years less young than me.
</pre>

    <p>In English, ``more'' comparatives are easier to make and use than ``less''
    comparatives, but in Lojban the two forms are equally easy.</p>

    ``-me'a'' are in fact used much more frequently than ``zmadu'' and ``mleca''
    themselves as selbri. It is highly unlikely for such lujvo to be construed as
    anything other than implicit-abstraction lujvo. But there is another type of
    ambiguity relevant to these lujvo, and which has to do with what is being
    compared.</p>

    <p>For example, does ``nelcymau'' mean ``X likes Y more than X likes Z'', or ``X
    likes Y more than Z likes Y''? Does ``klamau'' mean: ``X goes to Y more than to Z'',
    ``X goes to Y more than Z does'', ``X goes to Y from Z more than from W'', or
    what?</p>

    <p>We answer this concern by putting regularity above any considerations of concept
    usefulness: by convention, the two things being compared always fit into the first
    place of the seltau. In that way, each of the different possible interpretations can
    be expressed by SE-converting the seltau, and making the required place the new first
    place. As a result, we get the following comparative lujvo place structures:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d6" name="e15d6">15.6)</a>    ``nelcymau'': z1, more than z2, likes n2
        by amount z4
    ``selnelcymau'': z1, more than z2, is liked by n1
        in amount z4
    ``klamau'': z1, more than z2, goes to k2 from k3
        via k4 by means of k5
    ``selklamau'': z1, more than z2, is gone to by k1
        from k3 via k4 by means of k5
    ``terklamau'': z1, more than z2, is an origin point
        from destination k2 for k1's going via k4
        by means of k5
</pre>(See <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a> for the way in which this problem is
resolved when lujvo aren't used.)

    <p>The ordering rule places the things being compared first, and the other seltau
    places following. Unfortunately the z4 place, which expresses by how much one entity
    exceeds the other, is displaced into a lujvo place whose number is different for each
    lujvo. For example, while ``nelcymau'' has z4 as its fourth place, ``klamau'' has it
    as its sixth place. In any sentence where a difficulty arises, this amount-place can
    be redundantly tagged with ``vemau'' (for ``zmadu'') or ``veme'a'' (for ``mleca'') to
    help make the speaker's intention clear.</p>

    <p>It is important to realize that such comparative lujvo do not presuppose their
    seltau. Just as in English, saying someone is younger than someone else doesn't imply
    that they're young in the first place: an octogenarian, after all, is still younger
    than a nonagenarian. Rather, the 80-year-old has a greater ``ni citno'' than the
    90-year-old. Similarly, a 5-year-old is older than a 1-year-old, but is not
    considered ``old'' by most standards.</p>

    <p>There are some comparative concepts which are in which the ``se zmadu'' is
    difficult to specify. Typically, these involve comparisons implicitly made with a
    former state of affairs, where stating a z2 place explicitly would be
    problematic.</p>

    <p>In such cases, it is best not to use ``zmadu'' and leave the comparison hanging,
    but to use instead the gismu ``zenba'', meaning ``increase'' (and ``jdika'', meaning
    ``decrease'', in place of ``mleca''). The gismu ``zenba'' was included in the
    language precisely in order to capture those notions of increase which ``zmadu''
    can't quite cope with; in addition, we don't have to waste a place in lujvo or tanru
    on something that we'd never fill in with a value anyway. So we can translate ``I'm
    stronger now'' not as</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a>    mi ca tsamau
    I now am-stronger.
</pre>which implies that I'm stronger than somebody else (the elided occupant of the
second or z2 place), but as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d8" name="e15d8">15.8)</a>    mi ca tsaze'a
    I increase in strength.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, lujvo with a tertau of ``traji'' are used to build superlatives. The
    place structure of ``traji'' is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d9" name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    t1 is superlative in property t2, being
        the t3 extremum (largest by default) of set t4
</pre>

    <p>Consider the gismu ``xamgu'', whose place structure is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d10" name="e15d10">15.10)</a>  xa1 is good for xa2 by standard xa3
</pre>The comparative form is ``xagmau'', corresponding to English ``better'', with a
place structure (by the rules given above) of
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d11" name="e15d11">15.11)</a>  z1 is better than z2 for xa2 by standard xa3
        in amount z4
</pre>We would expect the place structure of ``xagrai'', the superlative form, to somehow
mirror that, given that comparatives and superlatives are comparable concepts, resulting
in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e15d12" name="e15d12">15.12)</a>  xa1=t1 is the best of the set t4 for xa2
        by standard xa3.
</pre>

    <p>The t2 place in ``traji'', normally filled by a property abstraction, is replaced
    by the seltau places, and the t3 place specifying the extremum of ``traji'' (whether
    the most or the least, that is) is presumed by default to be ``the most''.</p>

    <p>But the set against which the t1 place of ``traji'' is compared is not the t2
    place (which would make the place structure of ``traji'' fully parallel to that of
    ``zmadu''), but rather the t4 place. Nevertheless, by a special exception to the
    rules of place ordering, the t4 place of ``traji''-based lujvo becomes the second
    place of the lujvo. Some examples:</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16">16. Notes on gismu place structures</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16">Unlike the place structures of lujvo, the place structures
    of gismu were assigned in a far less systematic way through a detailed case-by-case
    analysis and repeated reviews with associated changes. (The gismu list is now
    baselined, so no further changes are contemplated.) Nevertheless, certain
    regularities were imposed both in the choice of places and in the ordering of places
    which may be helpful to the learner and the lujvo-maker, and which are therefore
    discussed here.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16">The choice of gismu places results from the varying outcome
    of four different pressures: brevity, convenience, metaphysical necessity, and
    regularity. (These are also to some extent the underlying factors in the lujvo place
    structures generated by the methods of this chapter.) The implications of each are
    roughly as follows:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16">Brevity tends to remove places: the fewer places a gismu
      has, the easier it is to learn, and the less specific it is. As mentioned
      in</a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-s16" name="s16"></a> <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>, a brivla with fewer
      place structures is less specific, and generality is a virtue in gismu, because
      they must thoroughly blanket all of semantic space.</dd>

      <dd>Convenience tends to increase the number of places: if a concept can be
      expressed as a place of some existing gismu, there is no need to make another
      gismu, a lujvo or a fu'ivla for it.</dd>

      <dd>Metaphysical necessity can either increase or decrease places: it is a pressure
      tending to provide the ``right number'' of places. If something is part of the
      essential nature of a concept, then a place must be made for it; on the other hand,
      if instances of the concept need not have some property, then this pressure will
      tend to remove the place.</dd>

      <dd>Regularity is a pressure which can also either increase or decrease places. If
      a gismu has a given place, then gismu which are semantically related to it are
      likely to have the place also.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Here are some examples of gismu place structures, with a discussion of the
    pressures operating on them:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    ``xekri'':  xe1 is black
</pre>Brevity was the most important goal here, reinforced by one interpretation of
metaphysical necessity. There is no mention of color standards here, as many people have
pointed out; like all color gismu, ``xekri'' is explicitly subjective. Objective color
standards can be brought in by an appropriate BAI tag such as ``ci'u'' (``in system'';
see <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>) or by making a lujvo.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e16d2" name=
"e16d2">16.2)</a>    ``jbena'': j1 is born to j2 at time j3 and location j4
</pre>

    <p>The gismu ``jbena'' contains places for time and location, which few other gismu
    have: normally, the time and place at which something is done is supplied by a tense
    tag (see <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>). However, providing these places
    makes ``le te jbena'' a simple term for ``birthday'' and ``le ve jbena'' for
    ``birthplace'', so these places were provided despite their lack of metaphysical
    necessity.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    ``rinka'': event r1 is the cause of event r2
</pre>The place structure of ``rinka'' does not have a place for the agent, the one who
causes, as a result of the pressure toward metaphysical necessity. A cause-effect
relationship does not have to include an agent: an event (such as snow melting in the
mountains) may cause another event (such as the flooding of the Nile) without any human
intervention or even knowledge.

    <p>Indeed, there is a general tendency to omit agent places from most gismu except
    for a few such as ``gasnu'' and ``zukte'' which are then used as tertau in order to
    restore the agent place when needed: see <a href="#s13">Section 13</a>.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-12-e16d4" name="e16d4">16.4)</a>    ``cinfo'': c1 is a lion of species/breed c2
</pre>The c2 place of ``cinfo'' is provided as a result of the pressure toward
regularity. All animal and plant gismu have such an c2 place; although there is in fact
only one species of lion, and breeds of lion, though they exist, aren't all that
important in talking about lions. The species/breed place must exist for such diversified
species as dogs, and for general terms like ``cinki'' (insect), and are provided for all
other animals and plants as a matter of regularity.

    <p>Less can be said about gismu place structure ordering, but some regularities are
    apparent. The places tend to appear in decreasing order of psychological saliency or
    importance. There is an implication within the place structure of ``klama'', for
    example, that ``lo klama'' (the one going) will be talked about more often, and is
    thus more important, than ``lo se klama'' (the destination), which is in turn more
    important than ``lo xe klama'' (the means of transport).</p>

    <p>Some specific tendencies (not really rules) can also be observed. For example,
    when there is an agent place, it tends to be the first place. Similarly, when a
    destination and an origin point are mentioned, the destination is always placed just
    before the origin point. Places such as ``under conditions'' and ``by standard'',
    which often go unfilled, are moved to near the end of the place structure.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s1" name="s1">1. What are attitudinal indicators?</a></h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s1" name=
    "s1">This chapter explains the various words that Lojban provides for expressing
    attitude and related notions. In natural languages, attitudes are usually expressed
    by the tone of voice when speaking, and (very imperfectly) by punctuation when
    writing. For example, the bare words</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John is coming.
</pre>can be made, through tone of voice, to express the speaker's feeling of happiness,
pity, hope, surprise, or disbelief. These fine points of tone cannot be expressed in
writing. Attitudes are also expressed with various sounds which show up in print as oddly
spelled words, such as the ``Oooh!'', ``Arrgh!'', ``Ugh!'', and ``Yecch!'' in the title.
These are part of the English language; people born to other languages use a different
set; yet you won't find any of these words in a dictionary.

    <p>In Lojban, everything that can be spoken can also be written. Therefore, these
    tones of voice must be represented by explicit words known as ``attitudinal
    indicators'', or just ``attitudinals''. This rule seems awkward and clunky to
    English-speakers at first, but is an essential part of the Lojbanic way of doing
    things.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to use attitudinal indicators is to place them at the beginning
    of a text. In that case, they express the speaker's prevailing attitude. Here are
    some examples, correlated with the attitudes mentioned following <a href=
    "#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  .ui la djan klama
    [Whee!] John is coming!
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  .uu la djan klama
    [Alas!] John is coming.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>  .a'o la djan klama
    [Hopefully] John is coming.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  .ue la djan klama
    [Wow!] John is coming!
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>  .ianai la djan klama
    [Nonsense!] John is coming.
</pre>The primary Lojban attitudinals are all the cmavo of the form VV or V'V: one of the
few cases where cmavo have been classified solely by their form. There are 39 of these
cmavo: all 25 possible vowel pairs of the form V'V, the four standard diphthongs
(``.ai'', ``.au'', ``.ei'', and ``.oi''), and the ten more diphthongs that are permitted
only in these attitudinal indicators and in names and borrowings (``.ia'', ``.ie'',
``.ii'', ``.io'', ``.iu'', ``.ua'', ``.ue'', ``.ui'', ``.uo'', and ``.uu''). Note that
each of these cmavo has a period before it, marking the pause that is mandatory before
every word beginning with a vowel. Attitudinals, like most of the other kinds of
indicators described in this chapter, belong to selma'o UI.

    <p>Attitudinals can also be compound cmavo, of the types explained in Sections 4-8;
    <a href="#e1d6">Example 1.6</a> illustrates one such possibility, the compound
    attitudinal ``.ianai''. In attitudinals, ``-nai'' indicates polar negation: the
    opposite of the simple attitudinal without the ``-nai''. Thus, as you might suppose,
    ``.ia'' expresses belief, since ``.ianai'' expresses disbelief.</p>

    <p>In addition to the attitudinals, there are other classes of indicators: intensity
    markers, emotion categories, attitudinal modifiers, observationals, and discursives.
    All of them are grammatically equivalent, which is why they are treated together in
    this chapter.</p>

    <p>Every indicator behaves in more or less the same way with respect to the grammar
    of the rest of the language. In general, one or more indicators can be inserted at
    the beginning of an utterance or after any word. Indicators at the beginning apply to
    the whole utterance; otherwise, they apply to the word that they follow. More details
    can be found in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>.</p>

    <p>Throughout this chapter, tables of indicators will be written in four columns. The
    first column is the cmavo itself. The second column is a corresponding English word,
    not necessarily a literal translation. The fourth column represents the opposite of
    the second column, and shows the approximate meaning of the attitudinal when suffixed
    with ``-nai''. The third column, which is sometimes omitted, indicates a neutral
    point between the second and fourth columns, and shows the approximate meaning of the
    attitudinal when it is suffixed with ``-cu'i''. The cmavo ``cu'i'' belongs to selma'o
    CAI, and is explained more fully in <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>.</p>

    <p>One flaw that the English glosses are particularly subject to is that in English
    it is often difficult to distinguish between expressing your feelings and talking
    about them, particularly with the limited resource of the written word. So the gloss
    for ``.ui'' should not really be ``happiness'' but some sound or tone that expresses
    happiness. However, there aren't nearly enough of those that have unambiguous or
    obvious meanings in English to go around for all the many, many different emotions
    Lojban speakers can readily express.</p>

    <p>Many indicators of CV'V form are loosely derived from specific gismu. The gismu
    should be thought of as a memory hook, not an equivalent of the cmavo. Such gismu are
    shown in this chapter between square brackets, thus: [gismu].</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2">2. Pure emotion indicators</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2">Attitudinals make no claim: they are expressions of attitude,
    not of facts or alleged facts. As a result, attitudinals themselves have no truth
    value, nor do they directly affect the truth value of a bridi that they modify.
    However, since emotional attitudes are carried in your mind, they reflect reactions
    to that version of the world that the mind is thinking about; this is seldom
    identical with the real world. At times, we are thinking about our idealized version
    of the real world; at other times we are thinking about a potential world that might
    or might not ever exist.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2">Therefore, there are two groups of attitudinals in Lojban.
    The ``pure emotion indicators'' express the way the speaker is feeling, without
    direct reference to what else is said. These indicators comprise the attitudinals
    which begin with ``u'' or ``o'' and many of those beginning with ``i''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2">The cmavo beginning with ``u'' are simple emotions, which
    represent the speaker's reaction to the world as it is, or as it is perceived to
    be.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2">Here are some typical uses of the ``u'' attitudinals:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s2" name="s2"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  .ua mi facki fi le mi mapku

    [Yay!] I found my hat!
        [emphasizes the feeling of happiness]

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>   .uo mi facki fi le mi mapku
    [At last!] I found my hat!
        [emphasizes that the finding is complete]
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  .uu do cortu
    [Pity!] You feel-pain.
        [expresses speaker's sympathy]

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>   .u'u do cortu
    [Repentance!] You feel-pain
        [expresses that speaker feels guilty]
</pre>In <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a>, note that the attitudinal ``.uo'' is translated
by an English non-attitudinal phrase: ``At last!'' It is common for the English
equivalents of Lojban attitudinals to be short phrases of this sort, with more or less
normal grammar, but actually expressions of emotion.

    <p>In particular, both ``.uu'' and ``.u'u'' can be translated into English as ``I'm
    sorry''; the difference between these two attitudes frequently causes confusion among
    English-speakers who use this phrase, leading to responses like ``Why are you sorry?
    It's not your fault!''</p>

    <p>It is important to realize that ``.uu'', and indeed all attitudinals, are meant to
    be used sincerely, not ironically. In English, the exclamation ``Pity!'' is just as
    likely to be ironically intended, but this usage does not extend to Lojban. Lying
    with attitudinals is (normally) as inappropriate to Lojban discourse as any other
    kind of lying: perhaps worse, because misunderstood emotions can cause even greater
    problems than misunderstood statements.</p>

    <p>The following examples display the effects of ``nai'' and ``cu'i'' when suffixed
    to an attitudinal:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  .ue la djan. klama
    [Surprise!] John comes.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>   .uecu'i la djan. klama
    [Ho hum.] John comes.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>   .uenai la djan. klama
    [Expected!] John comes.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e2d9">Example 2.9</a>, John's coming has been anticipated by the
    speaker. In <a href="#e2d7">Example 2.7</a> and <a href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a>, no
    such anticipation has been made, but in <a href="#e2d7">Example 2.7</a> the
    lack-of-anticipation goes no further --- in <a href="#e2d8">Example 2.8</a>, it
    amounts to actual surprise.</p>

    <p>It is not possible to firmly distinguish the pure emotion words beginning with
    ``o'' or ``i'' from those beginning with ``u'', but in general they represent more
    complex, more ambivalent, or more difficult emotions.</p>

    from the situation; in the latter example, John's coming is actually a relief of some
    kind.</p>

    <p>The pure emotion indicators beginning with ``i'' are those which could not be
    fitted into the ``u'' or ``o'' groups because there was a lack of room, so they are a
    mixed lot. ``.ia'', ``.i'a'', ``.ie'', and ``.i'e'' do not appear here, as they

</pre><a href="#e2d15">Example 2.15</a> shows an attitude-colored observative; the
attitudinal modifies the situation described by the observative, namely the mouse that is
causing the emotion. Lojban-speaking toddlers, if there ever are any, will probably use
sentences like <a href="#e2d15">Example 2.15</a> a lot.

    <p><a href="#e2d16">Example 2.16</a> and <a href="#e2d17">Example 2.17</a> use
    attitudinals that follow ``la djan.'' rather than being at the beginning of the

    of his coming; the speaker loves or disrespects John specifically. Compare:</p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e2d18" name="e2d18">2.18)</a>    la djan. klama .iu

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s3" name="s3">3. Propositional attitude indicators</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s3" name="s3">As mentioned at the beginning of</a> <a href="#s2">Section
    2</a>, attitudinals may be divided into two groups, the pure emotion indicators
    explained in that section, and a contrasting group which may be called the
    ``propositional attitude indicators''. These indicators establish an internal,
    hypothetical world which the speaker is reacting to, distinct from the world as it
    really is. Thus we may be expressing our attitude towards ``what the world would be
    like if ...'', or more directly stating our attitude towards making the potential
    world a reality.</p>

    <p>In general, the bridi paraphrases of pure emotions look (in English) something
    like ``I'm going to the market, and I'm happy about it''. The emotion is present with
    the subject of the primary claim, but is logically independent of it. Propositional
    attitudes, though, look more like ``I intend to go to the market'', where the main
    claim is logically subordinate to the intention: I am not claiming that I am actually
    going to the market, but merely that I intend to.</p>

    <p>There is no sharp distinction between attitudinals beginning with ``a'' and those
    beginning with ``e''; however, the original intent (not entirely realized due to the
    need to cram too many attitudes into too little space) was to make the members of the
    ``a''-series the purer, more attitudinal realizers of a potential world, while the
    members of the ``e''-series were more ambivalent or complex about the speaker's
    intention with regard to the predication. The relationship between the ``a''-series
    and the ``e''-series is similar to that between the ``u''-series and the
    ``o''-series, respectively. A few propositional attitude indicators overflowed into
    the ``i''-series as well.</p>

    <p>In fact, the entire distinction between pure emotions and propositional attitudes
    is itself a bit shaky: ``.u'u'' can be seen as a propositional attitude indicator
    meaning ``I regret that ...'', and ``a'e'' (discussed below) can be seen as a pure
    emotion meaning ``I'm awake/aware''. The division of the attitudinals into
    pure-emotion and propositional-attitude classes in this chapter is mostly by way of
    explanation; it is not intended to permit firm rulings on specific points.
    Attitudinals are the part of Lojban most distant from the ``logical language''
    aspect.</p>

    <p>Here is the list of propositional attitude indicators grouped by initial letter,
    starting with those beginning with ``a'':</p>
    <pre>
   .a'a    attentive   inattentive avoiding
    .a'e    alertness           exhaustion
    .ai intent      indecision  refusal

    <p>Some examples (of a parental kind):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  .a'a do zgana le veltivni

    [no interest] you complain
    I have no interest in your complaints.
</pre>(In a real-life situation, Examples 3.1-3.7 would also be decorated by various pure
emotion indicators, certainly including ``.oicai'', but probably also ``.iucai''.)

    <p>Splitting off the attitude into an indicator allows the regular bridi grammar to
    do what it does best: express the relationships between concepts that are intended,
    desired, hoped for, or whatever. Rephrasing these examples to express the attitude as
    the main selbri would make for unacceptably heavyweight grammar.</p>

    <p>Here are the propositional attitude indicators beginning with ``e'', which stand
    roughly in the relation to those beginning with ``a'' as the pure-emotion indicators
    beginning with ``o'' do to those beginning with ``u'' --- they are more complex or
    difficult:</p>
    <pre>
   .e'a    permission          prohibition
    .e'e    competence          incompetence
    .ei obligation          freedom

    .e'o    request             negative request

    <p>Finally, the propositional attitude indicators beginning with ``i'', which are the
    overflow from the other sets:</p>
    <pre>
   .ia belief      skepticism  disbelief

    .ie agreement           disagreement

</pre>

    <p>Still more examples (much, much later):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e3d13" name="e3d13">3.13)</a>    .ianai do pu pensi le nu tcica mi

    [disapproval] you [approval] act
    I don't approve of what you did, but I approve of you.
</pre><a href="#e3d16">Example 3.16</a> illustrates the use of a propositional attitude
indicator, ``i'e'', in both the usual sense (at the beginning of the bridi) and as a pure
emotion (attached to ``do''). The event expressed by the main bridi is disapproved of by
the speaker, but the referent of the sumti in the x1 place (namely the listener) is
approved of.

    <p>To indicate that an attitudinal discussed in this section is not meant to indicate
    a propositional attitude, the simplest expedient is to split the attitudinal off into
    a separate sentence. Thus, a version of <a href="#e3d8">Example 3.8</a> which
    actually claimed that the listener was or would be driving the car might be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e3d17" name="e3d17">3.17)</a>    do sazri le karce .i e'a
    You drive the car.  [Permission].
    You're driving (or will drive) the car,
        and that's fine.
</pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">4. Attitudes as scales</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">In Lojban, all emotions and attitudes are scales. These
    scales run from some extreme value (which we'll call ``positive'') to an opposite
    extreme (which we'll call ``negative''). In the tables above, we have seen three
    points on the scale: ``positive'', neutral, and ``negative''. The terms ``positive''
    and ``negative'' are put into scare quotes because they are loaded words when applied
    to emotions, and the attitudinal system reflects this loading, which is a known
    cultural bias. Only two of the ``positive'' words, namely ``.ii'' (fear) and ``.oi''
    (pain/complaint), represent emotions commonly thought of as less ``virtuous'' in most
    cases than their negative counterparts. But these two were felt to be instinctive,
    distinct, and very powerful emotions that needed to be expressible in a monosyllable
    when necessary, while their counterparts are less commonly expressed.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">(Why the overt bias? Because there are a lot of attitudinals
    and they will be difficult to learn as an entire set. By aligning our scales
    arbitrarily, we give the monosyllable ``nai'' a useful meaning and make it easier for
    a novice to recognize at least the positive or negative alignment of an indicator, if
    not the specific word. Other choices considered were ``random'' orientation, which
    would have unknown biases and be difficult to learn, and orientation based on our
    guesses as to which scale orientations made the most frequent usages shorter, which
    would be biased in favor of American perceptions of ``usefulness''. If bias must
    exist in our indicator set, it might as well be a known bias that eases learning, and
    in addition might as well favor a harmonious and positive world-view.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">In fact, though, each emotional scale has seven positions
    defined, three ``positive'' ones (shown below on the left), three ``negative'' ones
    (shown below on the right), and a neutral one indicating that no particular attitude
    on this scale is felt. The following chart indicates the seven positions of the scale
    and the associated cmavo. All of these cmavo, except ``nai'', are in selma'o
    CAI.</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">     cai     sai     ru'e   cu'i   nairu'e naisai  naicai
    [carmi] [tsali] [ruble] [cumki]
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s4" name="s4">A scalar attitude is expressed by using the attitudinal word,
and then following it by the desired scalar intensity. The bias creeps in because the
``negative'' emotions take the extra syllable ``nai'' to indicate their negative position
on the axis, and thus require a bit more effort to express.</a>

    <p>Much of this system is optional. You can express an attitude without a scale
    indicator, if you don't want to stop and think about how strongly you feel. Indeed,
    for most attitudinals, we've found that either no scalar value is used, or ``cai'' is
    used to indicate especially high intensity. Less often, ``ru'e'' is used for a
    recognizably weak intensity, and ``cu'i'' is used in response to the attitudinal
    question ``pei'' (see <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>) to indicate that the emotion is
    not felt.</p>

    <p>The following shows the variations resulting from intensity variation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  .ei
    I ought to
    (a non-specific obligation)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  .eicai
    I shall/must
    (an intense obligation or requirement, possibly
        a formal one)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  .eisai
    I should
    (a strong obligation or necessity, possibly an
        implied but not formal requirement)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  .eiru'e
    I might
    (a weak obligation --- in English often mixed
        with permission and desire)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  .eicu'i
    No matter
    (no particular obligation)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  .einai
    I need not
    (a non-obligation)
</pre>You can also utter a scale indicator without a specific emotion. This is often used
in the language: in order to emphasize a point about which you feel strongly, you mark
what you are saying with the scale indicator ``cai''. You could also indicate that you
don't care using ``cu'i'' by itself.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s5" name="s5">5. The space of emotions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s5" name="s5">Each of the attitude scales constitutes an axis in a
    multi-dimensional space. In effect, given our total so far of 39 scales, we have a
    39-dimensional space. At any given time, our emotions and attitudes are represented
    by a point in this 39-dimensional space, with the intensity indicators serving as
    coordinates along each dimension. A complete attitudinal inventory, should one decide
    to express it, would consist of reading off each of the scale values for each of the
    emotions, with the vector sum serving as a distinct single point, which is our
    attitude.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s5" name="s5">Now no one is going to ever utter a string of 100-odd
    attitudinals to express their emotions. If asked, we normally do not recognize more
    than one or two emotions at a time --- usually the ones that are strongest or which
    most recently changed in some significant way. But the scale system provides some
    useful insights into a possible theory of emotion (which might be testable using
    Lojban), and incidentally explains how Lojbanists express compound emotions when they
    do recognize them.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s5" name="s5">The existence of 39 scales highlights the complexity of
    emotion. We also aren't bound to the 39. There are modifiers described in</a>
    <a href="#s6">Section 6</a> that multiply the set of scales by an order of magnitude.
    You can also have mixed feelings on a scale, which might be expressed by ``cu'i'',
    but could also be expressed by using both the ``positive'' and ``negative'' scale
    emotions at once. One expression of ``fortitude'' might be ``.ii.iinai'' --- fear
    coupled with security.</p>

    <p>Uttering one or more attitudinals to express an emotion reflects several things.
    We will tend to utter emotions in their immediate order of importance to us. We feel
    several emotions at once, and our expression reflects these emotions simultaneously,
    although their order of importance to us is also revealing --- of our attitude
    towards our attitude, so to speak. There is little analysis necessary; for those
    emotions you feel, you express them; the ``vector sum'' naturally expresses the
    result. This is vital to their nature as attitudinals --- if you had to stop and
    think about them, or to worry about grammar, they wouldn't be emotions but
    rationalizations.</p>

    <p>People have proposed that attitudinals be expressed as bridi just like everything
    else; but emotions aren't logical or analytical --- saying ``I'm awed'' is not the
    same as saying ``Wow!!!''. The Lojban system is intended to give the effects of an
    analytical system without the thought involved. Thus, you can simply feel in
    Lojban.</p>

    <p>A nice feature of this design is that you can be simple or complex, and the system
    works the same way. The most immediate benefit is in learning. You only need to learn
    a couple of the scale words and a couple of attitude words, and you're ready to
    express your emotions Lojbanically. As you learn more, you can express your emotions
    more thoroughly and more precisely, but even a limited vocabulary offers a broad
    range of expression.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">6. Emotional categories</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">The Lojban attitudinal system was designed by starting with a
    long list of English emotion words, far too many to fit into the 39 available VV-form
    cmavo. To keep the number of cmavo limited, the emotion words in the list were
    grouped together by common features: each group was then assigned a separate cmavo.
    This was like making tanru in reverse, and the result is a collection of indicators
    that can be combined, like tanru, to express very complex emotions. Some examples in
    a moment.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">The most significant ``common feature'' we identified was
    that the emotional words on the list could easily be broken down into six major
    groups, each of which was assigned its own cmavo:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">   ro'a    social      asocial     antisocial
    ro'e    mental              mindless
    ro'i    emotional           denying emotion
    ro'o    physical            denying physical
    ro'u    sexual              sexual abstinence
    re'e    spiritual   secular     sacrilegious
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">Using these, we were able to assign ``o'u'' to mark a scale
    of what we might call ``generalized comfort''. When you are comfortable, relaxed,
    satisfied, you express comfort with ``o'u'', possibly followed by a scale indicator
    to indicate how comfortable you are. The six cmavo given above allow you to turn this
    scale into six separate ones, should you wish.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">For example, embarrassment is a social discomfort,
    expressible as ``.o'unairo'a''. Some emotions that we label ``stress'' in English are
    expressed in Lojban with ``.o'unairo'i''. Physical distress can be expressed with
    ``.o'unairo'o'', which makes a nice groan if you say it with feeling. Mental
    discomfort might be what you feel when you don't know the answer to the test
    question, but feel that you should. Most adults can recall some instance where we
    felt sexual discomfort, ``o'unairo'u''. Spiritual discomfort, ``o'unaire'e'', might
    be felt by a church-goer who has wandered into the wrong kind of religious
    building.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">Most of the time when expressing an emotion, you won't
    categorize it with these words. Emotional expressions should be quickly expressible
    without having to think about them. However, we sometimes have mixed emotions within
    this set, as for example emotional discomfort coupled with physical comfort or vice
    versa.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">Coupling these six words with our 39 attitude scales, each of
    which has a positive and negative side, already gives you far more emotional
    expression words than we have emotional labels in English. Thus, you'll never see a
    Lojban-English emotional dictionary that covers all the Lojban possibilities. Some
    may be useless, but others convey emotions that probably never had a word for them
    before, though many have felt them (``.eiro'u'', for example --- look it up).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">You can use scale markers and ``nai'' on these six category
    words, and you can also use category words without specifying the emotion. Thus,
    ``I'm trying to concentrate'' could be expressed simply as ``ro'e'', and if you are
    feeling anti-social in some non-specific way, ``ro'anai'' will express it.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">There is a mnemonic device for the six emotion categories,
    based on moving your arms about. In the following table, your hands begin above your
    head and move down your body in sequence.</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">   ro'a    hands above head    social
    ro'e    hands on head       intellectual
    ro'i    hands on heart      emotional
    ro'o    hands on belly      physical
    ro'u    hands on groin      sexual
    re'e    hands moving around spiritual
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">The implicit metaphors ``heart'' for emotional and ``belly''
    for physical are not really Lojbanic, but they work fine for
    English-speakers.</a></p>

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s6" name="s6">It turned out that, once we had devised the six emotion
categories, we also recognized some other commonalities among emotions. These tended to
fit nicely on scales of their own, but generally tend not to be thought of as separate
emotions. Some of these are self-explanatory, some need to be placed in context. Some of
these tend to go well with only a few of the attitudinals, others go with nearly all of
them. To really understand these modifiers, try to use them in combination with one or
two of the attitudinals found in</a> <a href="#s2">Sections 2</a> and <a href=
"#s3">3</a>, and see what emotional pictures you can build:

    <p>The cmavo ``ga'i'' expresses the scale used to indicate condescension or polite
    deference; it is not respect in general, which is ``.io''. Whatever it is attached to
    is marked as being below (for ``ga'i'') or above (for ``ga'inai'') the speaker's rank
    or social position. Note that it is always the referent, not the speaker or listener,
    who is so marked: in order to mark the listener, the listener must appear in the
    sentence, as with ``doi ga'inai'', which can be appended to a statement addressed to
    a social inferior.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  ko ga'inai
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [low-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    I would be honored if you would enter my residence.
</pre>Note that imperatives in Lojban need not be imperious! Corresponding examples with
``ga'icu'i'' and ``ga'inai'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  ko ga'icu'i
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [equal-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    Come on in to my place.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>   ko ga'i
        nenri klama le mi zdani
    you-imperative [high-rank!]
        enter-type-of come-to my house.
    You! Get inside!
</pre>

    <p>Since ``ga'i'' expresses the relative rank of the speaker and the referent, it
    does not make much sense to attach it to ``mi'', unless the speaker is using ``mi''
    to refer to a group (as in English ``we''), or a past or future version of himself
    with a different rank.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to attach ``ga'i'' to a whole bridi, in which case it
    expresses the speaker's superiority to the event the bridi refers to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  ga'i le xarju pu citka
    [high-rank!] the pig [past] eats
    The pig ate (which is an event beneath my notice).
</pre>When used without being attached to any bridi, ``ga'i'' expresses the speaker's
superiority to things in general, which may represent an absolute social rank:
``ga'icai'' is an appropriate opening word for an emperor's address from the throne.

    <p>The cmavo ``le'o'' represents the scale of aggressiveness. We seldom overtly
    recognize that we are feeling aggressive or defensive, but perhaps in counseling
    sessions, a psychologist might encourage someone to express these feelings on this
    scale. And football teams could be urged on by their coach using ``ro'ole'o''.
    ``le'o'' is also useful in threats as an alternative to ``o'onai'', which expresses
    anger.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``vu'e'' represents ethical virtue or its absence. An excess of almost
    any emotion is usually somewhat ``sinful'' in the eyes of most ethical systems. On
    the other hand, we often feel virtuous about our feelings --- what we call righteous
    indignation might be ``o'onaivu'e''. Note that this is distinct from lack of guilt:
    ``.u'unai''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``se'i'' expresses the difference between selfish and generous, for
    example (in combination with ``.au''):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  ause'i
    [desire] [self]
    I want it!

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>   ause'inai
    [desire] [other]
    I want you to have it!
</pre>

    <p>In both cases, the English ``it'' is vague, reflecting the absence of a bridi.
    <a href="#e7d5">Example 7.5</a> and <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a> are pure
    expressions of attitude. Analogously, ``.uuse'i'' is self-pity, whereas
    ``.uuse'inai'' is pity for someone else.</p>

    <p>The modifier ``ri'e'' indicates emotional release versus emotional control. ``I
    will not let him know how angry I am'', you say to yourself before entering the room.
    The Lojban is much shorter:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d7" name="e7d7">7.7)</a>  .o'onai ri'enai
    [anger] [control]
</pre>

    <p>On the other hand, ``ri'e'' can be used by itself to signal an emotional
    outburst.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``fu'i'' may express a reason for feeling the way we do, as opposed to a
    feeling in itself; but it is a reason that is more emotionally determined than most.
    For example, it could show the difference between the mental discomfort mentioned in
    <a href="#s6">Section 6</a> when it is felt on an easy test, as opposed to on a hard
    test. When someone gives you a back massage, you could use ``.o'ufu'i'' to show
    appreciation for the assistance in your comfort.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``be'u'' expresses, roughly speaking, whether the emotion it modifies is
    in response to something you don't have enough of, something you have enough of, or
    something you have too much of. It is more or less the attitudinal equivalent of the
    subjective quantifier cmavo ``mo'a'', ``rau'', and ``du'e'' (these belong to selma'o
    PA, and are discussed in <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>). For example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d8" name="e7d8">7.8)</a>  .uiro'obe'unai
    [Yay!] [physical] [Enough!]
</pre>might be something you say after a large meal which you enjoyed.

    <p>Like all modifiers, ``be'u'' can be used alone:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d9" name="e7d9">7.9)</a>  le cukta be'u cu zvati ma
    The book [Needed!] is at-location [what sumti?]
    Where's the book? --- I need it!
</pre>Lastly, the modifier ``se'a'' shows whether the feeling is associated with
self-sufficiency or with dependence on others.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d10" name="e7d10">7.10)</a>    .e'ese'a
    [I can!] [self-sufficient!]
    I can do it all by myself!
</pre>is something a Lojban-speaking child might say. On the other hand,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d11" name="e7d11">7.11)</a>    .e'ese'anai
    [I can!] [dependent]
    I can do it if you help me.
</pre>from the same child would indicate a (hopefully temporary) loss of self-
confidence. It is also possible to negate the ``.e'e'' in <a href="#e7d7">Example 7.7</a>
and <a href="#e7d8">Example 7.8</a>, leading to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d12" name="e7d12">7.12)</a>    .e'enaise'a
    [I can't] [self-sufficient]
    I can't do it by myself!
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e7d13" name="e7d13">7.13)</a>    .e'enaise'anai
    [I can't!] [dependent]
    I can't do it if you insist on ``helping'' me!
</pre>Some of the emotional expressions may seem too complicated to use. They might be
for most circumstances. It is likely that most combinations will never get used. But if
one person uses one of these expressions, another person can understand (as unambiguously
as the expresser intends) what emotion is being expressed. Most probably as the system
becomes well-known and internalized by Lojban-speakers, particular attitudinal
combinations will come to be standard expressions (if not cliches) of emotion.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">8. Compound indicators</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">The grammar of indicators is quite simple; almost all facets
    are optional. You can combine indicators in any order, and they are still
    grammatical. The presumed denotation is additive; thus the whole is the sum of the
    parts regardless of the order expressed, although the first expressed is presumed
    most important to the speaker. Every possible string of UI cmavo has some
    meaning.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">Within a string of indicators, there will be conventions of
    interpretation which amount to a kind of second-order grammar. Each of the modifier
    words is presumed to modify an indicator to the left, if there is one. (There is an
    ``unspecified emotion'' word, ``ge'e'', reserved to ensure that if you want to
    express a modifier without a root emotion, it doesn't attach to and modify a previous
    but distinct emotional expression.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">For example, ``.ieru'e'' expresses a weak positive value on
    the scale of agreement: the speaker agrees (presumably with the listener or with
    something else just stated), but with the least possible degree of intensity. But
    ``.ie ge'eru'e'' expresses agreement (at an unspecified level), followed by some
    other unstated emotion which is felt at a weak level. A rough English equivalent of
    ``.ie ge'eru'e'' might be ``I agree, but ...'' where the ``but'' is left hanging.
    (Again, attitudes aren't always expressed in English by English
    attitudinals.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">A scale variable similarly modifies the previous emotion
    word. You put the scale word for a root emotion word before a modifier, since the
    latter can have its own scale word. This merely maximizes the amount of information
    expressible. For example, ``.oinaicu'i ro'ucai'' expresses a feeling midway between
    pain (``.oi'') and pleasure (``.oinai'') which is intensely sexual (``ro'u'') in
    nature.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8">The cmavo ``nai'' is the most tightly bound modifier in the
    language: it always negates exactly one word --- the preceding one. Of all the words
    used in indicator constructs, ``nai'' is the only one with any meaning outside the
    indicator system. If you try to put an indicator between a non-indicator cmavo and
    its ``nai'' negator, the ``nai'' will end up negating the last word of the indicator.
    The result, though unambiguous, is not what you want. For example,</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s8" name="s8"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi .e .ui nai do
    I and [Yay!] [Not!] you
</pre>means ``I and (unfortunately) you'', whereas
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  mi .e nai .ui do
    I and [Not!] [Yay!] you
</pre>means ``I but (fortunately) not you''. Attitudinal ``nai'' expresses a ``scalar
negation'', a concept explained in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>; since every
attitudinal word implies exactly one scale, the effect of ``nai'' on each should be
obvious.

    <p>Thus, the complete internal grammar of UI is as follows, with each listed part
    optionally present or absent without affecting grammaticality, though it obviously
    would affect meaning.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>attitudinal ``nai'' intensity-word ``nai'' modifier ``nai'' intensity-word
      ``nai'' (possibly repeated)</dd>
    </dl>``ge'e'', the non-specific emotion word, functions as an attitudinal. If
    multiple attitudes are being expressed at once, then in the 2nd or greater position,
    either ``ge'e'' or a VV word must be used to prevent any modifiers from modifying the
    previous attitudinal.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s9" name="s9">9. The uses of indicators</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s9" name="s9">The behavior of indicators in the ``outside grammar'' is
    nearly as simple as their internal structure. Indicator groupings are identified
    immediately after the metalinguistic erasers ``si'', ``sa'', and ``su'' and some,
    though not all, kinds of quotations. The details of such interactions are discussed
    in</a> <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>.</p>

    <p>A group of indicators may appear anywhere that a single indicator may, except in
    those few situations (as in ``zo'' quotation, explained in <a href=
    "chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>) where compound cmavo may not be used.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of a text, indicators modify everything following them
    indefinitely: such a usage is taken as a raw emotional expression, and we normally
    don't turn off our emotions when we start and stop sentences. In every other place in
    an utterance, the indicator (or group) attaches to the word immediately to its left,
    and indicates that the attitude is being expressed concerning the object or concept
    to which the word refers.</p>

    <p>If the word that an indicator (or group) attaches to is itself a cmavo which
    governs a grammatical structure, then the indicator construct pertains to the
    referent of the entire structure. There is also a mechanism, discussed in <a href=
    "chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>, for explicitly marking the range of words to which
    an indicator applies.</p>

    <p>More details about the uses of indicators, and the way they interact with other
    specialized cmavo, are given in <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>. It is worth
    mentioning that real-world interpretation is not necessarily consistent with the
    formal scope rules. People generally express emotions when they feel them, with only
    a minimum of grammatical constraint on that expression; complexities of emotional
    expression are seldom logically analyzable. Lojban attempts to provide a systematic
    reference that could possibly be ingrained to an instinctive level. However, it
    should always be assumed that the referent of an indicator has some uncertainty.</p>

    <p>For example, in cases of multiple indicators expressed together, the combined form
    has some ambiguity of interpretation. It is possible to interpret the second
    indicator as expressing an attitude about the first, or to interpret both as
    expressing attitudes about the common referent. For example, in</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi pu tavla do .o'onai .oi
    I [past] talk-to you [Grrr!] [Oy!]
</pre>can be interpreted as expressing complaint about the anger, in which case it means
``Damn, I snapped at you''; or as expressing both anger and complaint about the listener,
in which case it means ``I told you, you pest!''

    <p>Similarly, an indicator after the final brivla of a tanru may be taken to express
    an attitude about the particular brivla placed there --- as the rules have it --- or
    about the entire bridi which hinges on that brivla. Remembering that indicators are
    supposedly direct expressions of emotion, this ambiguity is acceptable.</p>

    <p>Even if the scope rules given for indicators turn out to be impractical or
    unintuitive for use in conversation, they are still useful in written expression.
    There, where you can go back and put in markers or move words around, the scope rules
    can be used in lieu of elaborate nuances of body language and intonation to convey
    the writer's intent.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s10" name="s10">You can ask someone how they are feeling with a normal
    bridi sentence, but you will get a normal bridi answer in response, one which may be
    true or false. Since the response to a question about emotions is no more logical
    than the emotion itself, this isn't appropriate.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s10" name="s10">The word ``pei'' is therefore reserved for attitude
    questions. Asked by itself, it captures all of the denotation of English ``How are
    you?'' coupled with ``How do you feel?'' (which has a slightly different range of
    usage).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s10" name="s10">When asked in the context of discourse, ``pei'' acts like
    other Lojban question words --- it requests the respondent to ``fill in the blank'',
    in this case with an appropriate attitudinal describing the respondent's feeling
    about the referent expression. As with other questions, plausibility is polite; if
    you answer with an irrelevant UI cmavo, such as a discursive, you are probably making
    fun of the questioner. (A ``ge'e'', however, is always in order --- you are not
    required to answer emotionally. This is not the same as ``.i'inai'', which is privacy
    as the reverse of conviviality.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s10" name="s10">Most often, however, the asker will use ``pei'' as a place
    holder for an intensity marker. (As a result, ``pei'' is placed in selma'o CAI,

    difference between UI and CAI.) Such usage corresponds to a whole range of idiomatic

</pre>Empathy, which is not really an emotion, is expressed by the indicator ``dai''.
(Don't confuse empathy with sympathy, which is ``.uuse'inai''.) Sometimes, as when
telling a story, you want to attribute emotion to someone else. You can of course make a
bridi claim that so-and-so felt such-and-such an emotion, but you can also make use of
the attitudinal system by adding the indicator ``dai'', which attributes the preceding
attitudinal to someone else --- exactly whom, must be determined from context. You can
also use ``dai'' conversationally when you empathize, or feel someone else's emotion as
if it were your own:

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  le bloti .iidai .uu pu
        klama le xasloi
    the ship [fear!] [empathy] [pity!] [past]
        goes-to the ocean-floor
    Fearfully the ship, poor thing, sank.
</pre>suggesting that the ship felt fear at its impending destruction, and simultaneously
reporting the speaker's pity for it.

    <p>Both ``pei'' and ``dai'' represent exceptions to the normal rule that attitudinals
    reflect the speaker's attitude.</p>

    <p>Finally, we often want to report how our attitudes are changing. If our attitude
    has not changed, we can just repeat the attitudinal. (Therefore, ``.ui .ui .ui'' is
    not the same as ``.uicai'', but simply means that we are continuing to be happy.) If
    we want to report that we are beginning to feel, continuing to feel, or ceasing to
    feel an emotion, we can use the attitudinal contour cmavo ``bu'o''.</p>

    <p>When attached to an attitudinal, ``bu'o'' means that you are starting to have that
    attitude, ``bu'ocu'i'' that you are continuing to have it, and ``bu'onai'' that you
    are ceasing to have it. Some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>  o'onai bu'o
    [anger!] [start emotion]
    I'm getting angry!

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e10d12" name="e10d12">10.12)</a>   .iu bu'onai .uinai
    [love!] [end emotion] [unhappiness!]
    I don't love you any more; I'm sad.
</pre>

    <p>Note the difference in effect between <a href="#e10d12">Example 10.12</a> and:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e10d13" name="e10d13">10.13)</a>  mi ca ba'o prami do ja'e le nu
        mi badri
    I [present] [cessitive] love you with-result the event-of
        (I am-sad).
    I no longer love you; therefore, I am sad.
</pre>which is a straightforward bridi claim. <a href="#e10d13">Example 10.13</a> states
that you have (or have had) certain emotions; <a href="#e10d12">Example 10.12</a>
expresses those emotions directly.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s11" name="s11">11. Evidentials</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s11" name="s11">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s11" name="s11">   ja'o    I conclude
            [jalge]

    ju'a    I state [jufra]
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s11" name="s11">Now we proceed from the attitudinal indicators and their
relatives to the other, semantically unrelated, categories of indicators. The indicators
known as ``evidentials'' show how the speaker came to say the utterance; i.e. the source
of the information or the idea. Lojban's list of evidentials was derived from lists
describing several American Indian languages. Evidentials are also essential to the
constructed language L&aacute;adan, designed by the linguist and novelist Suzette Haden
Elgin. L&aacute;adan's set of indicators was drawn on extensively in developing the
Lojban indicator system.</a>

    <p>It is important to realize, however, that evidentials are not some odd system used
    by some strange people who live at the other end of nowhere: although their English
    equivalents aren't single words, English-speakers have vivid notions of what
    constitutes evidence, and of the different kinds of evidence.</p>

    <p>Like the attitudinal indicators, the evidentials belong to selma'o UI, and may be
    treated identically for grammatical purposes. Most of them are not usually considered
    scalar in nature, but a few have associated scales.</p>

    <p>A bridi with an evidential in it becomes ``indisputable'', in the sense that the
    speaker is saying ``how it is with him or her'', which is beyond argument. Claims
    about one's own mental states may be true or false, but are hardly subject to other
    people's examination. If you say that you think, or perceive, or postulate
    such-and-such a predication, who can contradict you? Discourse that uses evidentials
    has therefore a different rhetorical flavor than discourse that does not; arguments
    tend to become what can be called dialogues or alternating monologues, depending on
    your prejudices.</p>

    <p>Evidentials are most often placed at the beginning of sentences, and are often
    attached to the ``.i'' that separates sentences in connected discourse. It is in the
    nature of an evidential to affect the entire bridi in which it is placed: like the
    propositional attitude indicators, they strongly affect the claim made by the main
    bridi.</p>

    <p>A bridi marked by ``ja'o'' is a conclusion by the speaker based on other (stated
    or unstated) information or ideas. Rough English equivalents of ``ja'o'' are ``thus''
    and ``therefore''.</p>

    <p>A bridi marked by ``ca'e'' is true because the speaker says so. In addition to
    definitions of words, ``ca'e'' is also appropriate in what are called performatives,
    where the very act of speaking the words makes them true. An English example is ``I
    now pronounce you husband and wife'', where the very act of uttering the words makes
    the listeners into husband and wife. A Lojban translation might be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    ca'e le re do cu simxu speni
    [I define!] The two of-you are-mutual spouses.
</pre>The three scale positions of ``ba'a'', when attached to a bridi, indicate that it
is based on the speaker's view of the real world. Thus ``ba'a'' means that the statement
represents a future event as anticipated by the speaker; ``ba'acu'i'', a present event as
experienced by the speaker; ``ba'anai'', a past event as remembered by the speaker. It is
accidental that this scale runs from future to past instead of past to future.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    ba'acu'i le tuple be mi cu se cortu
    [I experience!] The leg of me is-the-locus-of-pain.
    My leg hurts.
</pre>A bridi marked by ``su'a'' is a generalization by the speaker based on other
(stated or unstated) information or ideas. The difference between ``su'a'' and ``ja'o''
is that ``ja'o'' suggests some sort of reasoning or deduction (not necessarily rigorous),
whereas ``su'a'' suggests some sort of induction or pattern recognition from existing
examples (not necessarily rigorous).

    <p>The opposite point of the scale, ``su'anai'', indicates abduction, or drawing
    specific conclusions from general premises or patterns.</p>

    <p>This cmavo can also function as a discursive (see <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>),
    in which case ``su'a'' means ``abstractly'' or ``in general'', and ``su'anai'' means
    ``concretely'' or ``in particular''.</p>

    <p>A bridi marked by ``ti'e'' is relayed information from some source other than the
    speaker. There is no necessary implication that the information was relayed via the
    speaker's ears; what we read in a newspaper is an equally good example of ``ti'e'',
    unless we have personal knowledge of the content.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    ti'e la .uengas cu zergau
    [I hear!] Wenga is-a-criminal-doer.
    I hear that Wenga is a crook.
</pre>A bridi marked by ``ka'u'' is one held to be true in the speaker's cultural
context, as a matter of myth or custom, for example. Such statements should be agreed on
by a community of people --- you cannot just make up your own cultural context ---
although ``objectivity'' in the sense of actual correspondence with the facts is
certainly not required.

    <p>On the other hand, ``se'o'' marks a bridi whose truth is asserted by the speaker
    as a result of an internal experience not directly available to others, such as a
    dream, vision, or personal revelation. In some cultures, the line between ``ka'u''
    and ``se'o'' is fuzzy or even nonexistent.</p>

    <p>A bridi marked by ``za'a'' is based on perception or direct observation by the
    speaker. This use of ``observe'' is not connected with the Lojban ``observative'', or
    bridi with the first sumti omitted. The latter has no explicit aspect, and could be a
    direct observation, a conclusion, an opinion, or other aspectual point of view.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    za'a do tatpi
    [I observe!] You are-tired.
    I see you are tired.
</pre>A bridi marked by ``pe'i'' is the opinion of the speaker. The form ``pe'ipei'' is
common, meaning ``Is this your opinion?''. (Strictly, this should be ``peipe'i'', in
accordance with the distinction explained in Examples 10.6-10.8, but since ``pe'i'' is
not really a scale, there is no real difference between the two orders.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    pe'i la kartagos. .ei se daspo
    [I opine!] Carthage [obligation] is-destroyed.
    In my opinion, Carthage should be destroyed.
</pre>A bridi marked by ``ru'a'' is an assumption made by the speaker. This is similar to
one possible use of ``.e'u''.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    ru'a doi livinston.
    Dr. Livingstone, I presume?
        (A rhetorical question: Stanley knew who he was.)
</pre>Finally, the evidential ``ju'a'' is used to avoid stating a specific basis for a
statement. It can also be used when the basis for the speaker's statement is not covered
by any other evidential. For the most part, using ``ju'a'' is equivalent to using no
evidential at all, but in question form it can be useful: ``ju'apei'' means ``What is the
basis for your statement?'' and serves as an evidential, as distinct from emotional,
question.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">12. Discursives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">The term ``discursive'' is used for those members of
    selma'o UI that provide structure to the discourse, and which show how a given word
    or utterance relates to the whole discourse. To express these concepts in regular
    bridi would involve extra layers of nesting: rather than asserting that ``I also
    came'', we would have to say ``I came; furthermore, the event of my coming is an
    additional instance of the relationship expressed by the previous sentence'', which
    is intolerably clumsy. Typical English equivalents of discursives are words or
    phrases like ``however'', ``summarizing'', ``in conclusion'', and ``for
    example''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">Discursives are not attitudinals: they express no
    particular emotion. Rather, they are abbreviations for metalinguistic claims that
    reference the sentence or text they are found in.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">Discursives are most often used at the beginning of
    sentences, often attached to the ``.i'' that separates sentences in running
    discourse, but can (like all other indicators) be attached to single words when it
    seems necessary or useful.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">The discursives discussed in this section are given in
    groups, roughly organized by function. First, the ``consecutive discourse''
    group:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">   ku'i    however/but/in contrast     [karbi]
    ji'a    additionally            [jmina]
    si'a    similarly           [simsa]
    mi'u    ditto               [mintu]
    po'o    the only relevant case
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s12" name="s12">These five discursives are mutually exclusive, and therefore
they are not usually considered as scales. The first four are used in consecutive
discourse. The first, ``ku'i'', makes an exception to the previous argument. The second,
``ji'a'', adds weight to the previous argument. The third, ``si'a'', adds quantity to the
previous argument, enumerating an additional example. The fourth, ``mi'u'', adds a
parallel case to the previous argument, and can also be used in tables or the like to
show that something is being repeated from the previous column. It is distinct from
``go'i'' (of selma'o GOhA, discussed in</a> <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>), which
is a non-discursive version of ``ditto'' that explicitly repeats the claim of the
previous bridi.

    <p>Lastly, ``po'o'' is used when there is no other comparable case, and thus
    corresponds to some of the uses of ``only'', a word difficult to express in pure
    bridi form:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    mi po'o darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi
    I [only] hit my cousin at-locus the nose.
    Only I (nobody else) hit my cousin on his nose.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a> mi darxi po'o le mi tamne fo le nazbi
    I hit [only] my cousin at-locus the nose.
    I only hit my cousin on his nose
        (I did nothing else to him).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a> mi darxi le mi tamne po'o fo le nazbi
    I hit my cousin [only] at-locus the nose.
    I hit only my cousin on his nose (no one else).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a> mi darxi le mi tamne fo le nazbi po'o
    I hit my cousin at-locus the nose [only].
    I hit my cousin only on his nose (nowhere else).
</pre>Note that ``only'' can go before or after what it modifies in English, but
``po'o'', as an indicator, always comes afterward.

    <p>Next, the ``commentary on words'' group:</p>
    <pre>
   va'i    in other words      in the same words
            [valsi]
    ta'u    expanding a tanru   making a tanru
            [tanru]
</pre>The discursives ``va'i'' and ``ta'u'' operate at the level of words, rather than
discourse proper, or if you like, they deal with how things are said. An alternative
English expression for ``va'i'' is ``rephrasing''; for ``va'inai'', ``repeating''. Also
compare ``va'i'' with ``ke'u'', discussed below.

    <p>The cmavo ``ta'u'' is a discursive unique to Lojban; it expresses the particularly
    Lojbanic device of tanru. Since tanru are semantically ambiguous, they are subject to
    misunderstanding. This ambiguity can be removed by expanding the tanru into some
    semantically unambiguous structure, often involving relative clauses or the
    introduction of additional brivla. The discursive ``ta'u'' marks the transition from
    the use of a brief but possibly confusing tanru to its fuller, clearer expansion; the
    discursive ``ta'unai'' marks a transition in the reverse direction.</p>

    <p>Next, the ``commentary on discourse'' group:</p>
    <pre>
   li'a    clearly/obviously       obscurely
            [klina]
    ba'u    exaggeration    accuracy    understatement
            [banli]
    zo'o    humorously  dully       seriously

    sa'e    precisely speaking      loosely speaking
            [satci]
    to'u    in brief            in detail
            [tordu]
    do'a    generously          parsimoniously
            [dunda]
    sa'u    simply              elaborating
            [sampu]
    pa'e    justice             prejudice
            [pajni]
    je'u    truly               falsely
            [jetnu]
</pre>This group is used by the speaker to characterize the nature of the discourse, so
as to prevent misunderstanding. It is well-known that listeners often fail to recognize a
humorous statement and take it seriously, or miss an exaggeration, or try to read more
into a statement than the speaker intends to put there. In speech, the tone of voice
often provides the necessary cue, but the reader of ironic or understated or imprecise
discourse is often simply clueless. As with the attitudinals, the use of these cmavo will
seem fussy to new Lojbanists, but it is important to remember that ``zo'o'', for example,
is the equivalent of smiling while you speak, not the equivalent of a flat declaration
like ``What I'm about to say is supposed to be funny.''

    <p>A few additional English equivalents: for ``sa'enai'', ``roughly speaking'' or
    ``approximately speaking''; for ``sa'unai'', ``furthermore''; for ``to'u'', ``in
    short'' or ``skipping details''; for ``do'a'', ``broadly construed''; for ``do'anai''
    (as you might expect), ``narrowly construed''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``pa'e'' is used to claim (truly or falsely) that one is being fair or
    just to all parties mentioned, whereas ``pa'enai'' admits (or proclaims) a bias in
    favor of one party.</p>

    <p>The scale of ``je'u'' and ``je'unai'' is a little different from the others in the
    group. By default, we assume that people speak the truth --- or at least, that if
    they are lying, they will do their best to conceal it from us. So under what
    circumstances would ``je'unai'' be used, or ``je'u'' be useful? For one thing,
    ``je'u'' can be used to mark a tautology: a sentence that is a truth of logic, like
    ``All cats are cats.'' Its counterpart ``je'unai'' then serves to mark a logical
    contradiction. In addition, ``je'unai'' can be used to express one kind of sarcasm or
    irony, where the speaker pretends to believe what he/she says, but actually wishes
    the listener to infer a contrary opinion. Other forms of irony can be marked with
    ``zo'o'' (humor) or ``.ianai'' (disbelief).</p>

    <p>When used as a discursive, ``su'a'' (see <a href="#s11">Section 11</a>) belongs to
    this group.</p>

    <p>Next, the ``knowledge'' group:</p>
    <pre>
   ju'o    certainly   uncertain   certainly not
            [djuno]
    la'a    probably            improbably
            [lakne]
</pre>These two discursives describe the speaker's state of knowledge about the claim of
the associated bridi. They are similar to the propositional attitudes of <a href="#s3">
    Section 3</a>, as they create a hypothetical world. We may be quite certain that
    something is true, and label our bridi with ``ju'o''; but it may be false all the
    same.

    <p>Next, the ``discourse management'' group:</p>
    <pre>
   ta'o    by the way          returning to point
            [tanjo]
    ra'u    chiefly     equally     incidentally
            [ralju]
    mu'a    for example omitting ex.    end examples
            [mupli]
    zu'u    on the one hand         on the other hand

    ke'u    repeating           continuing
            [krefu]
    da'i    supposing           in fact
</pre>This final group is used to perform what may be called ``managing the discourse'':
providing reference points to help the listener understand the flow from one sentence to
the next.

    <p>Other English equivalents of ``ta'onai'' are ``anyway'', ``anyhow'', ``in any
    case'', ``in any event'', ``as I was saying'', and ``continuing''.</p>

    <p>The scale of ``ra'u'' has to do with the importance of the point being, or about
    to be, expressed: ``ra'u'' is the most important point, ``ra'ucu'i'' is a point of
    equal importance, and ``ra'unai'' is a lesser point. Other English equivalents of
    ``ra'u'' are ``above all'' and ``primarily''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``ke'u'' is very similar to ``va'i'', although ``ke'unai'' and
    ``va'inai'' are quite different. Both ``ke'u'' and ``va'i'' indicate that the same
    idea is going to be expressed using different words, but the two cmavo differ in
    emphasis. Using ``ke'u'' emphasizes that the content is the same; using ``va'i''
    emphasizes that the words are different. Therefore, ``ke'unai'' shows that the
    content is new (and therefore the words are also); ``va'inai'' shows that the words
    are the same (and therefore so is the content). One English equivalent of ``ke'unai''
    is ``furthermore''.</p>

    <p>The discursive ``da'i'' marks the discourse as possibly taking a non-real-world
    viewpoint (``Supposing that'', ``By hypothesis''), whereas ``da'inai'' insists on the
    real-world point of view (``In fact'', ``In truth'', ``According to the facts''). A
    common use of ``da'i'' is to distinguish between:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a>     ganai da'i do viska le mi citno mensi
        gi ju'o do djuno le du'u ri pazvau
    If you [hypothetical] see my young sister,
        then [certain] you know that she is-pregnant.
    If you were to see my younger sister,
        you would certainly know she is pregnant.
</pre>and:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>     ganai da'inai do viska le mi citno mensi

        then [certainty] you know that she is-pregnant.
    If you saw my younger sister,
        you would certainly know she is pregnant.
</pre>

    <p>It is also perfectly correct to omit the discursive altogether, and leave the
    context to indicate which significance is meant. (Chinese always leaves this
    distinction to the context: the Chinese sentence</p>
    <pre>

</pre>is the equivalent of either <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a> or <a href="#e12d6">
    Example 12.6</a>.)

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s13" name="s13">The cmavo ``ki'a'' is one of the most common of the
miscellaneous indicators. It expresses metalinguistic confusion; i.e. confusion about
what has been said, as opposed to confusion not tied to the discourse (which is
``.uanai''). The confusion may be about the meaning of a word or of a grammatical
construct, or about the referent of a sumti. One of the uses of English ``which''
corresponds to ``ki'a'':</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    mi nelci le ctuca
    .i le ki'a ctuca

    I like the teacher
    Which teacher?
</pre>

    <p>Here, the second speaker does not understand the referent of the sumti ``le
    ctuca'', and so echoes back the sumti with the confusion marker.</p>

    <p>The metalinguistic negation cmavo ``na'i'' and its opposite ``jo'a'' are explained
    in full in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>. In general, ``na'i'' indicates
    that there is something wrong with a piece of discourse: either an error, or a false
    underlying assumption, or something else of the sort. The discourse is invalid or
    inappropriate due to the marked word or construct.</p>

    <p>Similarly, ``jo'a'' marks something which looks wrong but is in fact correct.
    These two cmavo constitute a scale, but are kept apart for two reasons: ``na'inai''
    means the same as ``jo'a'', but would be too confusing as an affirmation; ``jo'anai''
    means the same as ``na'i'', but is too long to serve as a convenient metalinguistic
    negator.</p>

    <p>The next two cmavo are used to assist in quoting texts written or spoken by
    others. It is often the case that we wish to quote only part of a text, or to supply
    additional material either by way of commentary or to make a fragmentary text
    grammatical. The cmavo ``li'o'' serves the former function. It indicates that words
    were omitted from the quotation. What remains of the quotation must be grammatical,
    however, as ``li'o'' does not serve any grammatical function. It cannot, for example,
    take the place of a missing selbri in a bridi, or supply the missing tail of a
    description sumti: ``le li'o'' in isolation is not grammatical.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``sa'a'' indicates in a quotation that the marked word or construct was
    not actually expressed, but is inserted for editorial, narrative, or grammatical
    purposes. Strictly, even a ``li'o'' should appear in the form ``li'osa'a'', since the
    ``li'o'' was not part of the original quotation. In practice, this and other forms
    which are already associated with metalinguistic expressions, such as ``sei'' (of
    selma'o SEI) or ``to'i'' (of selma'o TO) need not be marked except where confusion
    might result.</p>

    <p>In the rare case that the quoted material already contains one or more instances
    of ``sa'a'', they can be changed to ``sa'asa'a''.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``xu'' marks truth questions, which are discussed in detail in <a href=
    "chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>. In general, ``xu'' may be translated ``Is it true
    that ... ?'' and questions whether the attached bridi is true. When ``xu'' is
    attached to a specific word or construct, it directs the focus of the question to
    that word or construct.</p>

    <p>Lojban question words, unlike those of English, frequently do not stand at the
    beginning of the question. Placing the cmavo ``pau'' at the beginning of a bridi
    helps the listener realize that the bridi is a question, like the symbol at the
    beginning of written Spanish questions that looks like an upside-down question mark.
    The listener is then warned to watch for the actual question word.</p>

    <p>Although ``pau'' is grammatical in any location (like all indicators), it is not
    really useful except at or near the beginning of a bridi. Its scalar opposite,
    ``paunai'', signals that a bridi is not really a question despite its form. This is
    what we call in English a rhetorical question: an example appears in the English text
    near the beginning of <a href="#s11">Section 11</a>.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``pe'a'' is the indicator of figurative speech, indicating that the
    previous word should be taken figuratively rather than literally:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    mi viska le blanu pe'a zdani
    I see the blue [figurative] house.
    I see the ``blue'' house.
</pre>

    <p>Here the house is not blue in the sense of color, but in some other sense, whose
    meaning is entirely culturally dependent. The use of ``pe'a'' unambiguously marks a
    cultural reference: ``blanu'' in <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> could mean ``sad''
    (as in English) or something completely different.</p>

    <p>The negated form, ``pe'anai'', indicates that what has been said is to be
    interpreted literally, in the usual way for Lojban; natural-language intuition is to
    be ignored.</p>

    <p>Alone among the cmavo of selma'o UI, ``pe'a'' has a rafsi, namely ``pev''. This
    rafsi is used in forming figurative (culturally dependent) lujvo, whose place
    structure need have nothing to do with the place structure of the components. Thus
    ``risnyjelca'' (heart burn) might have a place structure like:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the heart of x2, burning in atmosphere x3 at temperature x4</dd>
    </dl>whereas ``pevrisnyjelca'', explicitly marked as figurative, might have the place
    structure:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is indigestion/heartburn suffered by x2</dd>
    </dl>which obviously has nothing to do with the places of either ``risna'' or
    ``jelca''.

    <p>The uses of ``bi'u'' and ``bi'unai'' correspond to one of the uses of the English
    articles ``the'' and ``a/an''. An English-speaker telling a story may begin with ``I
    saw a man who ...''. Later in the story, the same man will be referred to with the
    phrase ``the man''. Lojban does not use its articles in the same way: both ``a man''
    and ``the man'' would be translated ``le nanmu'', since the speaker has in mind a
    specific man. However, the first use might be marked ``le bi'u nanmu'', to indicate
    that this is a new man, not mentioned before. Later uses could correspondingly be
    tagged ``le bi'unai nanmu''.</p>

    <p>Most of the time, the distinction between ``bi'u'' and ``bi'unai'' need not be
    made, as the listener can infer the right referent. However, if a different man were
    referred to still later in the story, ``le bi'u nanmu'' would clearly show that this
    man was different from the previous one.</p>

    <p>Finally, the indicator ``ge'e'' has been discussed in <a href="#s8">Sections 8</a>
    and <a href="#s10">10</a>. It is used to express an attitude which is not covered by
    the existing set, or to avoid expressing any attitude.</p>

    <p>Another use for ``ge'e'' is to explicitly avoid expressing one's feeling on a
    given scale; in this use, it functions like a member of selma'o CAI: ``.iige'e''
    means roughly ``I'm not telling whether I'm afraid or not.''</p>
    <pre>
   kau indirect question
</pre>

    <p>This cmavo is explained in detail in <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>. It
    marks the word it is attached to as the focus of an indirect question:</p>
    <pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s14" name="s14">14. Vocative scales</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s14" name="s14">``Vocatives'' are words used to address someone directly;
    they precede and mark a name used in direct address, just as ``la'' (and the other
    members of selma'o LA) mark a name used to refer to someone. The vocatives actually
    are indicators --- in fact, discursives --- but the need to tie them to names and
    other descriptions of listeners requires them to be separated from selma'o UI. But
    like the cmavo of UI, the members of selma'o COI can be ``negated'' with ``nai'' to
    get the opposite part of the scale.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s14" name="s14">Because of the need for redundancy in noisy environments,
    the Lojban design does not compress the vocatives into a minimum number of scales.
    Doing so would make a non-redundant ``nai'' too often vital to interpretation of a
    protocol signal, as explained later in this section.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s14" name="s14">The grammar of vocatives is explained in</a> <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>; but in brief, a vocative may be followed by a name
    (without ``la''), a description (without ``le'' or its relatives), a complete sumti,
    or nothing at all (if the addressee is obvious from the context). There is an
    elidable terminator, ``do'u'' (of selma'o DOhU) which is almost never required unless
    no name (or other indication of the addressee) follows the vocative.</p>

    <p>Using any vocative except ``mi'e'' (explained below) implicitly defines the
    meaning of the pro-sumti ``do'', as the whole point of vocatives is to specify the
    listener, or at any rate the desired listener --- even if the desired listener isn't
    listening! We will use the terms ``speaker'' and ``listener'' for clarity, although
    in written Lojban the appropriate terms would be ``writer'' and ``reader''.</p>

    <p>In the following list of vocatives, the translations include the symbol X. This
    represents the name (or identifying description, or whatever) of the listener.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``doi'' is the general-purpose vocative. Unlike the cmavo of selma'o
    COI, explained below, ``doi'' can precede a name directly without an intervening
    pause. It is not considered a scale, and ``doinai'' is not grammatical. In general,
    ``doi'' needs no translation in English (we just use names by themselves without any
    preceding word, although in poetic styles we sometimes say ``Oh X'', which is
    equivalent to ``doi''). One may attach an attitudinal to ``doi'' to express various
    English vocatives. For example, ``doi .io'' means ``Sir/Madam!'', whereas ``doi
    .ionai'' means ``You there!''.</p>

    <p>All members of selma'o COI require a pause when used immediately before a name, in
    order to prevent the name from absorbing the COI word. This is unlike selma'o DOI and
    LA, which do not require pauses because the syllables of these cmavo are not
    permitted to be embedded in a Lojban name. When calling out to someone, this is
    fairly natural, anyway. ``Hey! John!'' is thus a better translation of ``ju'i
    .djan.'' than ``Hey John!''. No pause is needed if the vocative reference is
    something other than a name, as in the title of the Lojban journal, ``ju'i
    lobypli''.</p>

    <p>(Alternatively, ``doi'' can be inserted between the COI cmavo and the name, making
    a pause unnecessary: ``coi doi djan.'')</p>
    <pre>
   coi greetings
</pre>``Hello, X''; ``Greetings, X''; indicates a greeting to the listener.
    <pre>
   co'o    partings
</pre>``Good-bye, X''; indicates parting from immediate company by either the speaker or
the listener. ``coico'o'' means ``greeting in passing''.
    <pre>
   ju'i    attention   at ease     ignore me/us
            [jundi]
</pre>``Attention/Lo/Hark/Behold/Hey!/Listen, X''; indicates an important communication
that the listener should listen to.
    <pre>
   nu'e    promise     release promise non-promise
            [nupre]
</pre>``I promise, X''; indicates a promise to the listener. In some contexts, ``nu'e''
may be prefixed to an oath or other formal declaration.
    <pre>
   ta'a    interruption
            [tavla]
</pre>``I interrupt, X'', ``I desire the floor, X''; a vocative expression to (possibly)
interrupt and claim the floor to make a statement or expression. This can be used for
both rude and polite interruptions, although rude interruptions will probably tend not to
use a vocative at all. An appropriate response to an interruption might be ``re'i'' (or
``re'inai'' to ignore the interruption).
    <pre>
   pe'u    request
            [cpedu]
</pre>``Please, X''; indicates a request to the listener. It is a formal,
non-attitudinal, equivalent of ``.e'o'' with a specific recipient being addressed. On the
other hand, ``.e'o'' may be used when there is no specific listener, but merely a ``sense
of petition floating in the air'', as it were.
    <pre>
   ki'e    appreciation                disappreciation
            [ckire]
        gratitude           ingratitude
</pre>``Thank you, X''; indicates appreciation or gratitude toward the listener. The
usual response is ``je'e'', but ``fi'i'' is appropriate on rare occasions: see the
explanation of ``fi'i''.
    <pre>
   fi'i    welcome,        unwelcome,
        offering        inhospitality
            [friti]
</pre>``At your service, X''; ``Make yourself at home, X''; offers hospitality (possibly
in response to thanks, but not necessarily) to the listener. Note that ``fi'i'' is NOT
the equivalent of American English ``You're welcome'' as a mechanical response to ``Thank
you''; that is ``je'e'', as noted below.
    <pre>
   be'e    request to send
            [benji]
</pre>``Request to send to X''; indicates that the speaker wishes to express something,
and wishes to ensure that the listener is listening. In a telephone conversation, can be
used to request the desired conversant(s). A more colloquial equivalent is ``Hello? Can I
speak to X?''.
    <pre>
   re'i    ready to receive        not ready
            [bredi]
</pre>``Ready to receive, X''; indicates that the speaker is attentive and awaiting
communication from the listener. It can be used instead of ``mi'e'' to respond when
called to the telephone. The negative form can be used to prevent the listener from
continuing to talk when the speaker is unable to pay attention: it can be translated
``Hold on!'' or ``Just a minute''.
    <pre>
   mu'o    completion of utterance     more to follow
            [mulno]
</pre>``Over, X''; indicates that the speaker has completed the current utterance and is
ready to hear a response from the listener. The negative form signals that the pause or
non-linguistic sound which follows does not represent the end of the current utterance:
more colloquially, ``I'm not done talking!''
    <pre>
   je'e    successful          unsuccessful
         receipt            receipt
            [jimpe]
</pre>``Roger, X!'', ``I understand''; acknowledges the successful receipt of a
communication from the listener. The negative form indicates failure to receive
correctly, and is usually followed by ``ke'o''. The colloquial English equivalents of
``je'e'' and ``je'enai'' are the grunt typically written ``uh-huh'' and ``What?/Excuse
me?'': ``je'e'' is also used to mean ``You're welcome'' when that is a response to
``Thank you''.
    <pre>
   vi'o    will comply         will not comply
</pre>``Wilco, X'', ``I understand and will comply''. Similar to ``je'e'' but signals an
intention (similar to ``.ai'') to comply with the other speaker's request. This cmavo is
the main way of saying ``OK'' in Lojban, in the usual sense of ``Agreed!'', although
``.ie'' carries some of the same meaning. The negative form indicates that the message
was received but that you will not comply: a very colloquial version is ``No way!''.
    <pre>
   ke'o    please repeat           no repeat needed
            [krefu]
</pre>``What did you say, X?''; a request for repetition or clarification due to
unsuccessful receipt or understanding. This is the vocative equivalent of ``ki'a'', and
is related to ``je'enai''. The negative form may be rendered ``Okay, already; I get the
point!''
    <pre>
   fe'o    end of communication        not done
            [fanmo]
</pre>``Over and out, X''; indicates completion of statement(s) and communication
directed at the identified person(s). Used to terminate a letter if a signature is not
required because the sender has already been identified (as in memos). The negative form
means ``Wait, hold it, we're not done!'' and differs from ``mu'onai'' in that it means
more exchanges are to follow, rather than that the current exchange is incomplete.

    <p>Do not confuse ``fe'o'' with ``fa'o'' (selma'o FAhO) which is a mechanical,
    extra-grammatical signal that a text is complete. One may say ``fe'o'' to one
    participant of a multi-way conversation and then go on speaking to the others.</p>
    <pre>
   mi'e    self-identification     non-identification
        [cmavo: mi]
</pre>``And I am X''; a generalized self-vocative. Although grammatically just like the
other members of selma'o COI, ``mi'e'' is quite different semantically. In particular,
rather than specifying the listener, the person whose name (or description) follows
``mi'e'' is taken to be the speaker. Therefore, using ``mi'e'' specifies the meaning of
the pro-sumti ``mi''. It can be used to introduce oneself, to close letters, or to
identify oneself on the telephone.

    <p>This cmavo is often combined with other members of COI: ``fe'omi'e'' would be an
    appropriate closing at the end of a letter; ``re'imi'e'' would be a self-vocative
    used in delayed responses, as when called to the phone, or possibly in a roll-call.
    As long as the ``mi'e'' comes last, the following name is that of the speaker; if
    another COI cmavo is last, the following name is that of the listener. It is not
    possible to name both speaker and listener in a single vocative expression, but this
    fact is of no importance, because wherever one vocative expression is grammatical,
    any number of consecutive ones may appear.</p>

    <p>The negative form denies an identity which someone else has attributed to you;
    ``mi'enai .djan.'' means that you are saying you are not John.</p>

    <p>Many of the vocatives been listed with translations which are drawn from radio
    use: ``roger'', ``wilco'', ``over and out''. This form of translation does not mean
    that Lojban is a language of CB enthusiasts, but rather that in most natural
    languages these forms are so well handled by the context that only in specific
    domains (like speaking on the radio) do they need special words. In Lojban,
    dependence on the context can be dangerous, as speaker and listener may not share the
    right context, and so the vocatives provide a formal protocol for use when it is
    appropriate. Other appropriate contexts include computer communications and
    parliamentary procedure: in the latter context, the protocol question ``ta'apei''
    would mean ``Will the speaker yield?''</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s16" name="s16">16. Tentative conclusion</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s16" name="s16">The exact ramifications of the indicator system in actual
    usage are unknown. There has never been anything like it in natural language before.
    The system provides great potential for emotional expression and transcription, from
    which significant Sapir-Whorf effects can be anticipated. When communicating across
    cultural boundaries, where different indicators are often used for the same emotion,
    accidental offense can be avoided. If we ever ran into an alien race, a culturally
    neutral language of emotion could be vital. (A classic example, taken from the
    science fiction of Larry Niven, is to imagine speaking Lojban to the carnivorous
    warriors called Kzinti, noting that a human smile bares the teeth, and could be seen
    as an intent to attack.) And for communicating emotions to computers, when we cannot
    identify all of the signals involved in subliminal human communication (things like
    body language are also cultural), a system like this is needed.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-13-s16" name="s16">We have tried to err on the side of overkill. There are
    distinctions possible in this system that no one may care to make in any culture. But
    it was deemed more neutral to overspecify and let usage decide, than to choose a
    limited set and constrain emotional expression. For circumstances in which even the
    current indicator set is not enough, it is possible using the cmavo ``sei'',
    explained in</a> <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>, to create metalinguistic
    comments that act like indicators.</p>

    <p>We envision an evolutionary development. At this point, the system is little more
    than a mental toy. Many of you who read this will try playing around with various
    combinations of indicators, trying to figure out what emotions they express and when
    the expressions might be useful. You may even find an expression for which there
    currently is no good English word and start using it. Why not, if it helps you
    express your feelings?</p>

    <p>There will be a couple dozen of these used pretty much universally -- mostly just
    simple attitudinals with, at most, intensity markers. These are the ones that will
    quickly be expressed at the subconscious level. But every Lojbanist who plays with
    the list will bring in a couple of new words. Poets will paint emotional pictures,
    and people who identify with those pictures will use the words so created for their
    own experiences.</p>

    <p>Just as a library of tanru is built up, so will a library of attitudes be built.
    Unlike the tanru, though, the emotional expressions are built on some fairly nebulous
    root emotions --- words that cannot be defined with the precision of the gismu. The
    emotion words of Lojban will very quickly take on a life of their own, and the
    outline given here will evolve into a true system of emotions.</p>

    <p>There are several theories as to the nature of emotion, and they change from year
    to year as we learn more about ourselves. Whether or not Lojban's additive/scalar
    emotional model is an accurate model for human emotions, it does support the
    linguistic needs for expressing those emotions. Researchers may learn more about the
    nature of human emotions by exploring the use of the system by Lojban speakers. They
    also may be able to use the Lojban system as a means for more clearly recording
    emotions.</p>

    <p>The full list of scales and attitudes will probably not be used until someone
    speaks the language from birth. Until then, people will use the attitudes that are
    important to them. In this way, we counter cultural bias --- if a culture is prone to
    recognizing and/or expressing certain emotions more than others, its members will use
    only those out of the enormous set available. If a culture hides certain emotions,
    its members simply won't express them.</p>

    <p>Perhaps native Lojban speakers will be more expressively clear about their
    emotions than others. Perhaps they will feel some emotions more strongly than others
    in ways that can be correlated with the word choices; any difference from the norms
    of other cultures could be significant. Psychologists have devised elaborate tests
    for measuring attitudes and personality; this may be the easiest area in which to
    detect any systematic cultural effect of the type sought to confirm Sapir-Whorf,
    simply because we already have tools in existence to test it. Because Lojban is
    unique among languages in having such extensive and expressive indicators, it is
    likely that a Sapir-Whorf effect will occur and will be recognized.</p>

    <p>It is unlikely that we will know the true potential of a system like this one
    until and unless we have children raised entirely in a multi-cultural Lojban-speaking
    environment. We learn too many cultural habits in the realm of emotional
    communication ``at our mother's knee''. Such children will have a Lojban system that
    has stronger reinforcement than any typical culture system. The second generation of
    such children, then, could be said to be the start of a true Lojbanic culture.</p>

    <p>We shouldn't need to wait that long to detect significant effects. Emotion is so
    basic to our lives that even a small change or improvement in emotional communication
    would have immediately noticeable effects. Perhaps it will be the case that the most
    important contribution of our ``logical language'' will be in the non-logical realm
    of emotion!</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s1" name="s1">1. Logical connection and truth tables</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s1" name="s1">Lojban is a logical language: the name of the language itself
    means ``logical language''. The fundamentals of ordinary logic (there are variant
    logics, which aren't addressed in this book) include the notions of a ``sentence'',
    (sometimes called a ``statement'' or ``proposition''), which asserts a truth or
    falsehood, and a small set of ``truth functions'', which combine two sentences to
    create a new sentence. The truth functions have the special characteristic that the
    truth value (that is, the truth or falsehood) of the results depends only on the
    truth value of the component sentences. For example,</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s1" name="s1"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e1d1" name=
"e1d1">1.1)</a>  John is a man or James is a woman.
</pre>is true if ``John is a man'' is true, or if ``James is a woman'' is true. If we
know whether John is a man, and we know whether James is a woman, we know whether ``John
is a man or James is a woman'' is true, provided we know the meaning of ``or''. Here
``John is a man'' and ``James is a woman'' are the component sentences.

    <p>We will use the phrase ``negating a sentence'' to mean changing its truth value.
    An English sentence may always be negated by prefixing ``It is false that ... '', or
    more idiomatically by inserting ``not'' at the right point, generally before the
    verb. ``James is not a woman'' is the negation of ``James is a woman'', and vice
    versa. Recent slang can also negate a sentence by following it with the exclamation
    ``Not!''</p>

    <p>Words like ``or'' are called ``logical connectives'', and Lojban has many of them,
    as befits a logical language. This chapter is mostly concerned with explaining the
    forms and uses of the Lojban logical connectives. There are a number of other logical
    connectives in English such as ``and'', ``and/or'', ``if'', ``only if'', ``whether or
    not'', and others; however, not every use of these English words corresponds to a
    logical connective. This point will be made clear in particular cases as needed. The
    other English meanings are supported by different Lojban connective constructs.</p>

    <p>The Lojban connectives form a system (as the title of this chapter suggests),
    regular and predictable, whereas natural-language connectives are rather less
    systematic and therefore less predictable.</p>

    <p>There exist 16 possible different truth functions. A truth table is a graphical
    device for specifying a truth function, making it clear what the value of the truth
    function is for every possible value of the component sentences. Here is a truth
    table for ``or'':</p>
    <pre>
   first       second      result
    -------     -------     ------
    True        True        True
    True        False       True
    False       True        True
    False       False       False
</pre>

    <p>This table means that if the first sentence stated is true, and the second
    sentence stated is true, then the result of the truth function is also true. The same
    is true for every other possible combination of truth values except the one where
    both the first and the second sentences are false, in which case the truth value of
    the result is also false.</p>

    <p>Suppose that ``John is a man'' is true (and ``John is not a man'' is false), and
    that ``James is a woman'' is false (and ``James is not a woman'' is true). Then the
    truth table tells us that</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>``John is a man, or James is not a woman'' (true, true) is true; ``John is a
      man, or James is a woman'' (true, false) is true; ``John is not a man, or James is
      not a woman'' (false, true) is true; ``John is not a man, or James is a woman''
      (false, false) is false.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Note that the kind of ``or'' used in this example can also be expressed (in formal
    English) with ``and/or''. There is a different truth table for the kind of ``or''
    that means ``either ... or ... but not both''.</p>

    <p>To save space, we will write truth tables in a shorter format henceforth. Let the
    letters T and F stand for True and False. The rows will always be given in the order
    shown above: TT, TF, FT, FF for the two sentences. Then it is only necessary to give
    the four letters from the result column, which can be written TTTF, as can be seen by
    reading down the third column of the table above. So TTTF is the abbreviated truth
    table for the ``or'' truth function. Here are the 16 possible truth functions, with
    an English version of what it means to assert that each function is, in fact, true
    (``first'' refers to the first sentence, and ``second'' to the second sentence):</p>
    <pre>
   TTTT    (always true)
    TTTF    first is true and/or second is true.
    TTFT    first is true if second is true.
    TTFF    first is true whether or not second is true.
    TFTT    first is true only if second is true.
    TFTF    whether or not first is true, second is true.
    TFFT    first is true if and only if second is true.
    TFFF    first is true and second is true

    FTTT    first and second are not both true.
    FTTF    first or second is true, but not both.
    FTFT    whether or not first is true, second is false.
    FTFF    first is true, but second is false.
    FFTT    first is false whether or not second is true.
    FFTF    first is false, but second is true.
    FFFT    neither first nor second is true.
    FFFF    (always false)
</pre>

    <p>Skeptics may work out the detailed truth tables for themselves.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2">2. The Four basic vowels</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2">Lojban regards four of these 16 truth functions as
    fundamental, and assigns them the four vowels <span class="c3">A</span>, <span class=
    "c3">E</span>, <span class="c3">O</span>, and <span class="c3">U</span>. These
    letters do not represent actual cmavo or selma'o, but rather a component vowel from
    which actual logical-connective cmavo are built up, as explained in the next section.
    Here are the four vowels, their truth tables, and rough English equivalents:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2">   <span class="c3">A</span>   TTTF    or, and/or
    <span class="c3">E</span>   TFFF    and
    <span class="c3">O</span>   TFFT    if and only if
    <span class="c3">U</span>   TTFF    whether or not
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2">More precisely:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2"><span class="c3">A</span> is true if either or both
      sentences are true; <span class="c3">E</span> is true if both sentences are true,
      but not otherwise; <span class="c3">O</span> is true if the sentences are both true
      or both false; <span class="c3">U</span> is true if the first sentence is true,
      regardless of the truth value of the second sentence.</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s2" name="s2">With the four vowels, the ability to negate either
    sentence, and the ability to exchange the sentences, as if their order had been
    reversed, we can create all of the 16 possible truth functions except TTTT and FFFF,
    which are fairly useless anyway. The following table illustrates how to create each
    of the 14 remaining truth functions:</a>
    <pre>
   TTTF    <span class="c3">A</span>
    TTFT    <span class="c3">A</span> with second sentence negated
    TTFF    <span class="c3">U</span>
    TFTT    <span class="c3">A</span> with first sentence negated
    TFTF    <span class="c3">U</span> with sentences exchanged
    TFFT    <span class="c3">O</span>
    TFFF    <span class="c3">E</span>

    FTTT    <span class="c3">A</span> with both sentences negated
    FTTF    <span class="c3">O</span> with either first or second negated (not both)
    FTFT    <span class="c3">U</span> with sentences exchanged and then second negated
    FTFF    <span class="c3">E</span> with second sentence negated
    FFTT    <span class="c3">U</span> with first sentence negated
    FFTF    <span class="c3">E</span> with first sentence negated
    FFFT    <span class="c3">E</span> with both sentences negated
</pre>Note that exchanging the sentences is only necessary with <span class=
"c3">U</span>. The three other basic truth functions are commutative; that is, they mean
the same thing regardless of the order of the component sentences. There are other ways
of getting some of these truth tables; these just happen to be the methods usually
employed.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s3" name="s3">3. The six types of logical connectives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s3" name="s3">In order to remain unambiguous, Lojban cannot have only a
    single logical connective for each truth function. There are many places in the
    grammar of the language where logical connection is permitted, and each must have its
    appropriate set of connectives. If the connective suitable for sumti were used to
    connect selbri, ambiguity would result. Consider the English sentence:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s3" name="s3"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s3" name="s3"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e3d1" name=
"e3d1">3.1)</a>  Mary went to the window and  ... 
</pre>where the last word could be followed by ``the door'', a noun phrase, or by ``saw
the horses'', a sentence with subject omitted, or by ``John went to the door'', a full
sentence, or by one of a variety of other English grammatical constructions. Lojban
cannot tolerate such grammatical looseness.

    <p>Instead, there are a total of five different selma'o used for logical connection:
    A, GA, GIhA, GUhA, and JA. Each of these includes four cmavo, one based on each of
    the four vowels, which is always the last vowel in the cmavo. In selma'o A, the vowel
    is the entire cmavo.</p>

    <p>Thus, in selma'o A, the cmavo for the function <span class="c3">A</span> is ``a''.
    (Do not confuse A, which is a selma'o, with <span class="c3">A</span>, which is a
    truth function, or ``a'', which is a cmavo.) Likewise, the cmavo for <span class=
    "c3">E</span> in selma'o GIhA is ``gi'e'', and the cmavo for <span class=
    "c3">U</span> in selma'o GA is ``gu''. This systematic regularity makes the cmavo
    easier to learn.</p>

    <p>Obviously, four cmavo are not enough to express the 14 truth functions explained
    in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>. Therefore, compound cmavo must be used. These
    compound cmavo follow a systematic pattern: each has one cmavo from the five logical
    connection selma'o at its heart, and may also contain one or more of the auxiliary
    cmavo ``se'', ``na'', or ``nai''. Which auxiliaries are used with which logical
    connection cmavo, and with what grammar and meaning, will be explained in the
    following sections. The uses of each of these auxiliary cmavo relates to its other
    uses in other parts of Lojban grammar.</p>

    <p>For convenience, each of the types of compound cmavo used for logical connection
    is designated by a Lojban name. The name is derived by changing the final ``-A'' of
    the selma'o name to ``-ek''; the reasons for using ``-ek'' are buried deep in the
    history of the Loglan Project. Thus, compound cmavo based on selma'o A are known as
    eks, and those based on selma'o JA are known as jeks. (When writing in English, it is
    conventional to use ``eks'' as the plural of ``ek''.) When the term ``logical
    connective'' is used in this chapter, it refers to one or more of these kinds of
    compound cmavo.</p>

    <p>Why does the title of this section refer to ``six types'' when there are only five
    selma'o? A jek may be preceded by ``.i'', the usual Lojban cmavo for connecting two
    sentences. The compound produced by ``.i'' followed by a jek is known as an ijek. It
    is useful to think of ijeks as a sixth kind of logical connective, parallel to eks,
    jeks, geks, giheks, and guheks.</p>

    <p>There also exist giks, joiks, ijoiks, and joigiks, which are not logical
    connectives but are other kinds of compound cmavo which will be introduced later.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s4" name="s4">4. Logical connection of bridi</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s4" name="s4">Now we are ready to express</a> <a href="#e1d1">Example
    1.1</a> in Lojban! The kind of logical connective which is placed between two Lojban
    bridi to connect them logically is an ijek:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man or James is-a-woman.
</pre>

    <p>Here we have two separate Lojban bridi, ``la djan. nanmu'' and ``la djeimyz.
    ninmu''. These bridi are connected by ``.ija'', the ijek for the truth function
    <span class="c3">A</span>. The ``.i'' portion of the ijek tells us that we are
    dealing with separate sentences here. Similarly, we can now say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ije la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man and James is-a-woman.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijo la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>   la djan. nanmu .iju la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man whether-or-not James is-a-woman.
</pre>To obtain the other truth tables listed in <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>, we need to
know how to negate the two bridi which represent the component sentences. We could negate
them directly by inserting ``na'' before the selbri, but Lojban also allows us to place
the negation within the connective itself.

    <p>To negate the first or left-hand bridi, prefix ``na'' to the JA cmavo but after
    the ``.i''. To negate the second or right-hand bridi, suffix ``-nai'' to the JA
    cmavo. In either case, the negating word is placed on the side of the connective that
    is closest to the bridi being negated.</p>

    <p>So to express the truth table FTTF, which requires <span class="c3">O</span> with
    either of the two bridi negated (not both), we can say either:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  la djan. nanmu .inajo la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>   la djan. nanmu .ijonai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman
</pre>

    <p>The meaning of both <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> and <a href="#e4d6">Example
    4.6</a> is the same as that of:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  John is a man or James is a woman, but not both.
</pre>

    <p>Here is another example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d8" name="e4d8">4.8)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man or James is-not-a-woman.
    John is a man if James is a woman.
</pre>How's that again? Are those two English sentences in <a href="#e4d8">Example
4.8</a> really equivalent? In English, no. The Lojban TTFT truth function can be glossed
``A if B'', but the ``if'' does not quite have its English sense. <a href="#e4d8">Example
4.8</a> is true so long as John is a man, even if James is not a woman; likewise, it is
true just because James is not a woman, regardless of John's gender. This kind of
``if-then'' is technically known as a ``material conditional''.

    <p>Since James is not a woman (by our assertions in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>), the
    English sentence ``John is a man if James is a woman'' seems to be neither true nor
    false, since it assumes something which is not true. It turns out to be most
    convenient to treat this ``if'' as TTFT, which on investigation means that <a href=
    "#e4d8">Example 4.8</a> is true. <a href="#e4d9">Example 4.9</a>, however, is equally
    true:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d9" name="e4d9">4.9)</a>  la djan. ninmu .ijanai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a woman if James is a woman.
</pre>This can be thought of as a principle of consistency, and may be paraphrased as
follows: ``If a false statement is true, any statement follows from it.'' All uses of
English ``if'' must be considered very carefully when translating into Lojban to see if
they really fit this Lojban mold. <a href="#e4d10">Example 4.10</a>, which uses the TFTT
truth function, is subject to the same rules: the stated gloss of TFTT as ``only if''
works naturally only when the left-hand bridi is true; if it is false, the right-hand
bridi may be either true or false. The last gloss of <a href="#e4d10">Example 4.10</a>
illustrates the use of ``if ... then'' as a more natural substitute for ``only if''.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d10" name="e4d10">4.10)</a>    la djan. nanmu .inaja la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man or James is-a-woman.
    John is a man only if James is a woman.
    If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre>The following example illustrates the use of ``se'' to, in effect, exchange the two
sentences. The normal use of ``se'' is to (in effect) tranpose places of a bridi, as
explained in <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e4d11" name="e4d11">4.11)</a>    la djan. nanmu .iseju la djeimyz. ninmu
    Whether or not John is a man, James is a woman.
</pre>If both ``na'' and ``se'' are present, which is legal but never necessary, ``na''
would come before ``se''.

    <p>The full syntax of ijeks, therefore, is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>.i [na] [se] JA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>where the cmavo in brackets are optional.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s5" name="s5">5. Forethought bridi connection</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s5" name="s5">Many concepts in Lojban are expressible in two different
    ways, generally referred to as ``afterthought'' and ``forethought''.</a> <a href=
    "#s4">Section 4</a> discussed what is called ``afterthought bridi logical
    connection''. The word ``afterthought'' is used because the connective cmavo and the
    second bridi were added, as it were, afterwards and without changing the form of the
    first bridi. This form might be used by someone who makes a statement and then wishes
    to add or qualify that statement after it has been completed. Thus,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  la djan. nanmu
</pre>is a complete bridi, and adding an afterthought connection to make
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  la djan. nanmu .ija la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is a man or James is a woman (or both)
</pre>provides additional information without requiring any change in the form of what
has come before, which may not be possible or practical, especially in speaking. (The
meaning, however, may be changed by the use of a negating connective.) Afterthought
connectives make it possible to construct all the important truth-functional
relationships in a variety of ways.

    <p>In forethought style the speaker decides in advance, before expressing the first
    bridi, that a logical connection will be expressed. Forethought and afterthought
    connectives are expressed with separate selma'o: the forethought logical connectives
    corresponding to afterthought ijeks are geks:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  ga la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    Either John is a man or James is a woman (or both).
</pre>``ga'' is the cmavo which represents the <span class="c3">A</span> truth function
in selma'o GA. The word ``gi'' does not belong to GA at all, but constitutes its own
selma'o: it serves only to separate the two bridi without having any content of its own.
The English translation of ``ga ... gi'' is ``either ... or'', but in the English form
the truth function is specified both by the word ``either'' and by the word ``or'': not
so in Lojban.

    <p>Even though two bridi are being connected, geks and giks do not have any ``.i'' in
    them. The forethought construct binds up the two bridi into a single sentence as far
    as the grammar is concerned.</p>

    <p>Some more examples of forethought bridi connection are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  ge la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    (It is true that)
    both John is a man and James is a woman.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  gu la djan. nanmu
        gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    It is true that John is a man,
        whether or not James is a woman.
</pre>

    <p>It is worth emphasizing that <a href="#e5d5">Example 5.5</a> does not assert that
    James is (or is not) a woman. The ``gu'' which indicates that ``la djeimyz. ninmu''
    may be true or false is unfortunately rather remote from the bridi thus affected.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most important of the truth functions commonly expressed in
    forethought is TFTT, which can be paraphrased as ``if ... then ... '':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ganai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    Either John is not a man, or James is a woman.
    If John is a man, then James is a woman.
</pre>Note the placement of the ``nai'' in <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>. When added to
afterthought selma'o such as JA, a following ``nai'' negates the second bridi, to which
it is adjacent. Since GA cmavo precede the first bridi, a following ``nai'' negates the
first bridi instead.

    <p>Why does English insist on forethought in the translation of <a href=
    "#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>? Possibly because it would be confusing to seemingly assert a
    sentence and then make it conditional (which, as the Lojban form shows, involves a
    negation). Truth functions which involve negating the first sentence may be
    confusing, even to the Lojbanic understanding, when expressed using afterthought.</p>

    <p>It must be reiterated here that not every use of English ``if ... then'' is
    properly translated by ``.inaja'' or ``ganai ... gi''; anything with implications of
    time needs a somewhat different Lojban translation, which will be discussed in
    <a href="#s18">Section 18</a>. Causal sentences like ``If you feed the pig, then it
    will grow'' are not logical connectives of any type, but rather need a translation
    using ``rinka'' as the selbri joining two event abstractions, thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  le nu do cidja dunda fi le xarju
        cu rinka le nu ri ba banro
    The event-of (you food-give to the pig)
        causes the event-of (it will grow).
</pre>

    <p>Causality is discussed in far more detail in <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter
    9</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="#e5d8">Example 5.8</a> and <a href="#e5d9">Example 5.9</a> illustrates a
    truth function, FTTF, which needs to negate either the first or the second bridi. We
    already understand how to negate the first bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  gonai la djan. nanmu gi la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-not-a-man if-and-only-if James is-a-woman,
    Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.
</pre>How can the second bridi be negated? By adding ``-nai'' to the ``gi''.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  go la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu
    John is-a-man if-and-only-if James is-not-a-woman.
    Either John is a man or James is a woman but not both.
</pre>A compound cmavo based on ``gi'' is called a gik; the only giks are ``gi'' itself
and ``ginai''.

    <p>Further examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e5d10" name="e5d10">5.10)</a>    ge la djan. nanmu ginai la djeimyz. ninmu

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s6" name="s6">6. sumti connection</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s6" name="s6">Geks and ijeks are sufficient to state every possible logical
    connection between two bridi. However, it is often the case that two bridi to be
    logically connected have one or more portions in common:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s6" name="s6"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  la djan. klama le zarci
        .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
    John goes to the market,
        and Alice goes to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Here only a single sumti differs between the two bridi. Lojban does not require
    that both bridi be expressed in full. Instead, a single bridi can be given which
    contains both of the different sumti and uses a logical connective from a different
    selma'o to combine the two sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  la djan .e la .alis. klama le zarci
    John and Alice go-to the market.
</pre><a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> means exactly the same thing as <a href="#e6d1">
    Example 6.1</a>: one may be rigorously transformed into the other without any change
    of logical meaning. This rule is true in general for every different kind of logical
    connection in Lojban; all of them, with one exception (see <a href="#s12">Section
    12</a>), can always be transformed into a logical connection between sentences that
    expresses the same truth function.

    <p>The afterthought logical connectives between sumti are eks, which contain a
    connective cmavo of selma'o A. If ijeks were used in <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a>,
    the meaning would be changed:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  la djan. .ije la .alis. klama le zarci
    John [is/does something].  And Alices goes-to the market.
</pre>leaving the reader uncertain why John is mentioned at all.

    <p>Any ek may be used between sumti, even if there is no direct English
    equivalent:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  la djan. .o la .alis. klama le zarci
    John if-and-only-if Alice goes-to the market.
    John goes to the market if, and only if, Alice does.
</pre>

    <p>The second line of <a href="#e6d3">Example 6.3</a> is highly stilted English, but
    the first line (of which it is a literal translation) is excellent Lojban.</p>

    <p>What about forethought sumti connection? As is the case for bridi connection, geks
    are appropriate. They are not the only selma'o of forethought logical-connectives,
    but are the most commonly used ones.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  ga la djan. gi la .alis. klama le zarci
    Either John or Alice (or both) goes-to the market.
</pre>Of course, eks include all the same patterns of compound cmavo that ijeks do. When
``na'' or ``se'' is part of an ek, a special writing convention is invoked, as in the
following example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  la djan. na.a la .alis. klama le zarci
    John only if Alice goes-to the market.
    John goes to the market only if Alice does.
</pre>

    <p>Note the period in ``na.a''. The cmavo of A begin with vowels, and therefore must
    always be preceded by a pause. It is conventional to write all connective compounds
    as single words (with no spaces), but this pause must still be marked in writing as
    in speech; otherwise, the ``na'' and ``a'' would tend to run together.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>Of the three properties --- German-ness, wealth, and manhood -- I possess
      either exactly one or else all three.</dd>
    </dl>Because of the counterintuitiveness of this outcome, it is safest to avoid
    <span class="c3">O</span> with more than two sentences. Likewise, the connectives
    which involve negation also have unexpected truth values when used with more than two
    sentences.

    <p>In fact, no combination of logical connectives can produce the ``all or none''
    interpretation intended (but not achieved) by <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> without
    repeating one of the bridi. See <a href="#e8d11">Example 8.11</a>.</p>

    <p>There is an additional difficulty with the use of more than two sentences. What is
    the meaning of:</p>

</pre><a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a> is the correct translation of <a href=
"#e7d4">Example 7.4</a>. The reason is that Lojban logical connectives pair off from the
left, like many constructs in the language. This rule, called the left-grouping rule, is
easy to forget, especially when intuition pulls the other way. Forethought connectives
are not subject to this problem:

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s8" name="s8">8. Grouping of afterthought connectives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s8" name="s8">There are several ways in Lojban to render</a> <a href=
    "#e7d5">Example 7.5</a> using afterthought only. The simplest method is to make use
    of the cmavo ``bo'' (of selma'o BO). This cmavo has several functions in Lojban, but
    is always associated with high precedence and short scope. In particular, if ``bo''
    is placed after an ijek, the result is a grammatically distinct kind of ijek which
    overrides the regular left-grouping rule. Connections marked with ``bo'' are
    interpreted before connections not so marked. <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> is
    equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e7d8">Example 7.8</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi nelci la djan.
        .ije mi nelci la martas.
        .ijabo mi nelci la meris.
    I like John,
        and I like Martha or I like Mary.
</pre>

    <p>The English translation feebly indicates with a comma what the Lojban marks far
    more clearly: the ``I like Martha'' and ``I like Mary'' sentences are joined by
    ``.ija'' first, before the result is joined to ``I like John'' by ``.ije''.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>Eks can have ``bo'' attached in exactly the same way, so that <a href=
      "#e8d2">Example 8.2</a> is equivalent in meaning to Example 8.l:</dd>

      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a></dt>

      <dd>mi nelci la djan. .e la martas. .abo la meris.</dd>
    </dl>Forethought connectives, however, never can be suffixed with ``bo'', for every
    use of forethought connectives clearly indicates the intended pattern of grouping.

    <p>What happens if ``bo'' is used on both connectives, giving them the same high
    precedence, as in <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a>?</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  mi nelci la djan. .ebo la martas. .abo la meris.
</pre>Does this wind up meaning the same as <a href="#e7d4">Example 7.4</a> and
    <a href="#e7d6">Example 7.6</a>? Not at all. A second rule relating to ``bo'' is that
    where several ``bo''-marked connectives are used in succession, the normal Lojban
    left-grouping rule is replaced by a right-grouping rule. As a result, <a href=
    "#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> in fact means the same as <a href="#e8d1">Examples 8.1</a>
    and <a href="#e8d2">8.2</a>. This rule may be occasionally exploited for special
    effects, but is tricky to keep straight; in writing intended to be easy to
    understand, multiple consecutive connectives marked with ``bo'' should be avoided.

    <p>The use of ``bo'', therefore, gets tricky in complex connections of more than
    three sentences. Looking back at the English translations of <a href="#e7d7">Examples
    7.7</a> and <a href="#e7d8">7.8</a>, parentheses were used to clarify the grouping.
    These parentheses have their Lojban equivalents, two sets of them actually. ``tu'e''
    and ``tu'u'' are used with ijeks, and ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' with eks and other
    connectives to be discussed later. (``ke'' and ``ke'e'' are also used in other roles
    in the language, but always as grouping markers). Consider the English sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  I kiss you and you kiss me,
        if I love you and you love me.
</pre>where the semantics tells us that the instances of ``and'' are meant to have higher
precedence than that of ``if''. If we wish to express <a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a> in
afterthought, we can say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi cinba do .ije[bo] do cinba mi
        .ijanai mi prami do .ijebo do prami mi
    I kiss you and you kiss me,
        if I love you and you love me.
</pre>marking two of the ijeks with ``bo'' for high precedence. (The first ``bo'' is not
strictly necessary, because of the left-grouping rule, and is shown here in brackets.)

    <p>But it may be clearer to use explicit parenthesis words and say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  tu'e mi cinba do .ije do cinba mi tu'u
        .ijanai tu'e mi prami do .ije do prami mi [tu'u]
    ( I kiss you and you kiss me )
        if ( I love you and you love me ).
</pre>where the ``tu'e ... tu'u'' pairs set off the structure. The cmavo ``tu'u'' is an
elidable terminator, and its second occurrence in <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a> is
bracketed, because all terminators may be elided at the end of text.

    <p>In addition, parentheses are a general solution: multiple parentheses may be
    nested inside one another, and additional afterthought material may be added without
    upsetting the existing structure. Neither of these two advantages apply to ``bo''
    grouping. In general, afterthought constructions trade generality for simplicity.</p>

    <p>Because of the left-grouping rule, the first set of ``tu'e ... tu'u'' parentheses
    may actually be left off altogether, producing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  mi cinba do .ije do cinba mi
        .ijanai tu'e mi prami do .ije do prami mi [tu'u]
    I kiss you and you kiss me
        if ( I love you and you love me ).
</pre>

    <p>What about parenthesized sumti connection? Consider</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  I walk to either the market and the house,
        or the school and the office.
</pre>Two pairs of parentheses, analogous to <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a>, would seem
to be the right approach. However, it is a rule of Lojban grammar that a sumti may not
begin with ``ke'', so the first set of parentheses must be omitted, producing
    <a href="#e8d10">Example 8.10</a>, which is instead parallel to <a href=
    "#e8d7">Example 8.7</a>:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  mi dzukla le zarci .e le zdani
        .a ke le ckule .e le briju [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market and the house
        or ( the school and the office ).
</pre>If sumti were allowed to begin with ``ke'', unavoidable ambiguities would result,
so ``ke'' grouping of sumti is allowed only just after a logical connective. This rule
does not apply to ``tu'e'' grouping of bridi, as <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a> shows.

    <p>Now we have enough facilities to handle the problem of <a href="#e7d3">Example
    7.3</a>: ``I am German, rich, and a man --- or else none of these.'' The following
    paraphrase has the correct meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>     [tu'e] mi dotco .ijo mi ricfu [tu'u]
        .ije tu'e mi dotco .ijo mi nanmu [tu'u]
    ( I am-German if-and-only-if I am-rich )
        and (I am-German if-and-only-if I am-a-man ).
</pre>

    <p>The truth table, when worked out, produces T if and only if all three component
    sentences are true or all three are false.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s9" name="s9">9. Compound bridi</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s9" name="s9">So far we have seen how to handle two sentences that need
    have no similarity at all (bridi connection) and sentences that are identical except
    for a difference in one sumti (sumti connection). It would seem natural to ask how to
    logically connect sentences that are identical except for having different
    selbri.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s9" name="s9">Surprise! Lojban provides no logical connective that is
    designed to handle selbri and nothing else. Instead, selbri connection is provided as
    part of a more general-purpose mechanism called ``compound bridi''. Compound bridi
    result from logically connecting sentences that differ in their selbri and possibly
    some of their sumti.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s9" name="s9">The simplest cases result when the x1 sumti is the only
    common point:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d1" name=
"e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci .ije mi nelci la djan.
    I go to the market, and I like John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to the compound bridi:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  mi klama le zarci gi'e nelci la djan.
    I go-to the market and like John.
</pre>As <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> indicates, giheks are used in afterthought to
create compound bridi; ``gi'e'' is the gihek corresponding to ``and''. The actual phrases
``klama le zarci'' and ``nelci la djan.'' that the gihek connects are known as
``bridi-tails'', because they represent (in this use) the ``tail end'' of a bridi,
including the selbri and any following sumti, but excluding any sumti that precede the
selbri:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  mi ricfu gi'e klama le zarci
    I am-rich and go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d3">Example 9.3</a>, the first bridi-tail is ``ricfu'', a simple
    selbri, and the second bridi-tail is ``klama le zarci'', a selbri with one following
    sumti.</p>

    <p>Suppose that more than a single sumti is identical between the two sentences:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  mi dunda le cukta do
        .ije mi lebna lo rupnu do
    I give the book to-you,
        and I take some currency-units from-you.
</pre>In <a href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a>, the first and last sumti of each bridi are
identical; the selbri and the second sumti are different. By moving the final sumti to
the beginning, a form analogous to <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> can be achieved:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  fi do fa mi dunda le cukta
        gi'e lebna lo rupnu
    to/from you I give the book
        and take some currency-units.
</pre>where the ``fi'' does not have an exact English translation because it merely
places ``do'' in the third place of both ``lebna'' and ``dunda''. However, a form that
preserves natural sumti order also exists in Lojban. Giheks connect two bridi-tails, but
also allow sumti to be added following the bridi-tail. These sumti are known as
tail-terms, and apply to both bridi. The straightforward gihek version of <a href=
"#e9d4">Example 9.4</a> therefore is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  mi dunda le cukta
        gi'e lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I (give the book)
        and (take some currency-units) to/from you.
</pre>The ``vau'' (of selma'o VAU) serves to separate the bridi-tail from the tail-terms.
Every bridi-tail is terminated by an elidable ``vau'', but only in connection with
compound bridi is it ever necessary to express this ``vau''. Thus:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  mi klama le zarci [vau]
    I go-to the market.
</pre>has a single elided ``vau'', and <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> is equivalent to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  mi klama le zarci [vau]
        gi'e nelci la djan. [vau] [vau]
</pre>where the double ``vau'' at the end of <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> terminates
both the right-hand bridi-tail and the unexpressed tail-terms.

    <p>A final use of giheks is to combine bridi-tails used as complete sentences, the
    Lojban observative:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le briju
    A goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.
</pre>Since x1 is omitted in both of the bridi underlying <a href="#e9d9">Example
9.9</a>, this compound bridi does not necessarily imply that the goer and the walker are
the same. Only the presence of an explicit x1 (other than ``zo'e'', which is equivalent
to omission) can force the goer and the walker to be identical.

    <p>A strong argument for this convention is provided by analysis of the following
    example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>     klama la nu,IORK. la finyks.
        gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
    A goer to-New York from-Phoenix
        and a goer to-New York from-Rome.
</pre>

    <p>If the rule were that the x1 places of the two underlying bridi were identified,
    then (since there is nothing special about x1), the unspecified x4 (route) and x5
    (means) places would also have to be the same, leading to the absurd result that the
    route from Phoenix to New York is the same as the route from Rome to New York.
    Inserting ``da'', meaning roughly ``something'', into the x1 place cures the
    problem:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e9d11" name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    da klama la nu,IORK. la finyks.
        gi'e klama la nu,IORK. la rom.
    Something is-a-goer to-New York from-Phoenix
        and is-a-goer to-New York from-Rome.
</pre>The syntax of giheks is:

    <dl>
      <dd>[na] [se] GIhA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>which is exactly parallel to the syntax of eks.

    <p>is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> and <a href=
    "#e8d2">Example 8.2</a>. Likewise, ``ke ... ke'e'' grouping can be used after
    giheks:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi dzukla le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani

    I walk-to the market and walk-to the house,
        or walk-to the school and walk-to the office.
</pre>is the gihek version of <a href="#e8d9">Example 8.9</a>. The same rule about using
``ke ... ke'e'' bracketing only just after a connective applies to bridi-tails as to
sumti, so the first two bridi-tails in <a href="#e10d2">Example 10.2</a> cannot be
explicitly grouped; implicit left-grouping suffices to associate them.

    <p>Each of the pairs of bridi-tails joined by multiple giheks can have its own set of
    tail-terms:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    mi dejni lo rupnu la djan.
        .inaja mi dunda le cukta la djan.
        .ijabo mi lebna le cukta la djan.
    [If] I owe some currency-units to John,
        then I give the book to John
        or I take the book from John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi dejni lo rupnu nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau
        le cukta vau la djan.
    [If] I owe some currency-units then (give or take)
        a book to/from John.
</pre>

    <p>The literal English translation in <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is almost
    unintelligible, but the Lojban is perfectly grammatical. ``mi'' fills the x1 place of
    all three selbri; ``lo rupnu'' is the x2 of ``dejni'', whereas ``le cukta'' is a
    tail-term shared between ``dunda'' and ``lebna''; ``la djan.'' is a tail-term shared
    by ``dejni'' and by ``dunda gi'abo lebna''. In this case, greater clarity is probably
    achieved by moving ``la djan.'' to the beginning of the sentence, as in <a href=
    "#e9d5">Example 9.5</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    fi la djan. fa mi dejni lo rupnu
        nagi'a dunda gi'abo lebna vau le cukta
    To/from John, [if] I owe some currency-units
        then [I] give or take the book.
</pre>Finally, what about forethought logical connection of bridi-tails? There is no
direct mechanism for the purpose. Instead, Lojban grammar allows a pair of
forethought-connected sentences to function as a single bridi-tail, and of course the
sentences need not have terms before their selbri. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d5.5" name="e10d5.5">10.5.5)</a>    mi ge klama le zarci gi nelci la djan.
    I both go to the market and like John.
</pre>is equivalent in meaning to <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>.

    <p>Of course, either of the connected sentences may contain giheks:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    mi ge klama le zarci gi'e dzukla le zdani
        gi nelci la djan.
    I both (go to the market and walk to the house)
        and like John.
</pre>The entire gek-connected sentence pair may be negated as a whole by prefixing
``na'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    mi na ge klama le zarci gi dzukla le zdani
    [False!] I both go to the market and walk to the house.
</pre>Since a pair of sentences joined by geks is the equivalent of a bridi-tail, it may
be followed by tail terms. The forethought equivalent of <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a>
is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    mi ge dunda le cukta
         gi lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I both (give the book)
        and (take some currency-units) to/from you.
</pre>Here is a pair of gek-connected observatives, a forethought equivalent of
    <a href="#e9d9">Example 9.9</a>:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    ge klama le zarci gi dzukla le briju
    Both a goer to-the market and a walker to-the office.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, here is an example of gek-connected sentences with both shared and
    unshared terms before their selbri:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>  mi gonai le zarci cu klama

    connection; sentences that differ in one sumti only, and permit sumti connection; and
    sentences that differ in the selbri and possibly one or more sumti, and permit
    bridi-tail connection. Termset logical connectives are employed for sentences that
    differ in more than one sumti but not in the selbri, such as:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    I go to the market from the office
        and to the house from the school.
</pre>The Lojban version of <a href="#e11d1">Example 11.1</a> requires two termsets
joined by a logical connective. A ``term'' is either a sumti or a sumti preceded by a
tense or modal tag such as ``pu'' or ``bai''. Afterthought termsets are formed by linking
terms together by inserting the cmavo ``ce'e'' (of selma'o CEhE) between each of them.
Furthermore, the logical connective (which is a jek) must be prefixed by the cmavo
``pe'e'' (of selma'o PEhE). (We could refer to the combination of ``pe'e'' and a jek as a
``pehejek'', I suppose.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    mi klama le zarci ce'e le briju pe'e je
        le zdani ce'e le ckule
    I go to-the market [plus] from-the office [joint] and
        to-the house [plus] from-the school.
</pre>

    <p>The literal translation uses ``[plus]'' to indicate the termset connective, and
    ``[joint]'' to indicate the position of the logical connective joint. As usual, there
    is an equivalent bridi-connection form:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    mi klama le zarci le briju
        .ije mi klama le zdani le ckule
    I go to-the market from-the office,
        and I go to-the house from-the school.
</pre>which illustrates that the two bridi differ in the x2 and x3 places only.

    <p>What happens if the two joined sets of terms are of unequal length? Expanding to
    bridi connection will always make clear which term goes in which place of which
    bridi. It can happen that a sumti may fall in the x2 place of one bridi and the x3
    place of another:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    mi pe'e ja do ce'e le zarci
        cu klama le briju
    I [joint] or you to-the market [plus]
        go to/from-the office.
</pre>can be clearly understood by expansion to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    mi klama le briju
        .ija do le zarci cu klama le briju
    I go to-the office,
        or you to-the market go from-the office.
</pre>So ``le briju'' is your origin but my destination, and thus falls in the x2 and x3
places of ``klama'' simultaneously! This is legal because even though there is only one
selbri, ``klama'', there are two distinct bridi expressed here. In addition, ``mi'' in
<a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> is serving as a termset containing only one term. An
analogous paradox applies to compound bridi with tail-terms and unequal numbers of sumti
within the connected bridi-tails:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>     mi klama le zarci gi'e dzukla vau le briju
    I (go to-the market and walk) to/from-the office.
</pre>means that I go to the market from the office, and I walk to the office; ``le
briju'' is the x3 place of ``klama'' and the x2 place of ``dzukla''.

    <p>Forethought termsets also exist, and use ``nu'i'' of selma'o NUhI to signal the
    beginning and ``nu'u'' of selma'o NUhU (an elidable terminator) to signal the end.
    Nothing is inserted between the individual terms: they simply sit side-by-side. To
    make a logical connection in a forethought termset, use a gek, with the gek just
    after the ``nu'i'', and an extra ``nu'u'' just before the gik:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a>    mi klama nu'i ge le zarci le briju
        nu'u gi le zdani le ckule [nu'u]
    I go [start termset] both to-the market from-the office
        [joint] and to-the house from-the school
        [end termset].
</pre>

    <p>Note that even though two termsets are being connected, only one ``nu'i'' is
    used.</p>

    <p>The grammatical uses of termsets that do not contain logical connectives are

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s12" name="s12">12. Logical connection within tanru</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s12" name="s12">As noted at the beginning of</a> <a href="#s9">Section
    9</a>, there is no logical connective in Lojban that joins selbri and nothing but
    selbri. However, it is possible to have logical connectives within a selbri, forming
    a kind of tanru that involves a logical connection. Consider the simple tanru ``blanu
    zdani'', blue house. Now anything that is a blue ball, in the most ordinary
    understanding of the phrase at least, is both blue and a ball. And indeed, instead of
    ``blanu bolci'', Lojbanists can say ``blanu je bolci'', using a jek connective within
    the tanru. (We saw jeks used in <a href="#s11">Section 11</a> also, but there they
    were always prefixed by ``pe'e''; in this section they are used alone.) Here is a
    pair of examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    ti blanu zdani
    This is-a-blue type-of house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a> ti blanu je zdani
    This is-blue and a-house.
</pre>But of course <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> and <a href="#e12d2">Example
12.2</a> are not necessarily equivalent in meaning! It is the most elementary point about
Lojban tanru that <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> might just as well mean
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    This is a house for blue inhabitants.
</pre>and <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> certainly is not equivalent in meaning to
<a href="#e12d3">Example 12.3</a>.

    <p>A full explanation of logical connection within tanru belongs rather to a
    discussion of selbri structure than to logical connectives in general. Why? Because
    although <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> happens to mean the same as</p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    ti blanu gi'e zdani
</pre>and therefore as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a>    ti blanu .ije ti zdani
</pre>the rule of expansion into separate bridi simply does not always work for tanru
connection. Supposing Alice to be a person who lives in blue houses, then
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    la .alis. cu blanu je zdani prenu
    Alice is-a (blue and house) type-of-person.
</pre>would be true, because tanru grouping with a jek has higher precedence than
unmarked tanru grouping, but:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    la .alis. cu blanu prenu
        .ije la .alis. cu zdani prenu
    Alice is-a blue person,
        and Alice is-a house person.
</pre>is probably false, because the blueness is associated with the house, not with
Alice, even leaving aside the question of what it means to say ``Alice is a blue
person''. (Perhaps she belongs to the Blue team, or is wearing blue clothes.) The
semantic ambiguity of tanru make such logical manipulations impossible.

    <p>It suffices to note here, then, a few purely grammatical points about tanru
    logical connection. ``bo'' may be appended to jeks as to eks, with the same
    rules:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d8" name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    la teris. cu ricfu je nakni jabo fetsi
    Terry is rich and (male or female).
</pre>The components of tanru may be grouped with ``ke'' both before and after a logical
connective:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d9" name="e12d9">12.9)</a>    la .teris. cu [ke] ricfu ja pindi [ke'e]
        je ke nakni ja fetsi [ke'e]
    Terry is (rich or poor)
        and (male or female).
</pre>where the first ``ke ... ke'e'' pair may be omitted altogether by the rule of
left-grouping, but is optionally permitted (as in bridi connection). In any case, both
instances of ``ke'e'' may be elided.

    <p>The syntax of jeks is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>[na] [se] JA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>parallel to eks and giheks.

    <p>Forethought tanru connection does not use geks, but uses guheks instead. Guheks
    have exactly the same form as geks:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>[se] GUhA [nai]</dd>
    </dl>Using guheks in tanru connection (rather than geks) resolves what would
    otherwise be an unacceptable ambiguity between bridi-tail and tanru connection:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d10" name="e12d10">12.10)</a>  la .alis. gu'e ricfu gi fetsi
    Alice is both rich and female.
</pre>Note that giks are used with guheks in exactly the same way they are used with
geks. Like jeks, guheks bind more closely than unmarked tanru grouping does:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d11" name="e12d11">12.11)</a>  la .alis. gu'e blanu gi zdani prenu
    Alice is-a-(both blue and a-house) type-of-person.
</pre>is the forethought version of <a href="#e12d6">Example 12.6</a>.

    <p>A word of caution about the use of logically connected tanru within descriptions.
    English-based intuition can lead the speaker astray. In correctly reducing</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d12" name="e12d12">12.12)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .ije mi viska pa ninmu
    I see a man, and I see a woman.
</pre>to
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d13" name="e12d13">12.13)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .e pa ninmu
    I see a man and a woman.
</pre>there is a great temptation to reduce further to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e12d14" name="e12d14">12.14)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu je ninmu
    I see a man and woman.
</pre>

    <p>But <a href="#e12d14">Example 12.14</a> means that you see one thing which is both
    a man and a woman simultaneously! A ``nanmu je ninmu'' is a manwoman, a presumably
    non-existent creature who is both a ``nanmu'' and a ``ninmu''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s13" name="s13">13. Truth questions and connective questions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s13" name="s13">So far we have addressed only sentences which are
    statements. Lojban, like all human languages, needs also to deal with sentences which
    are questions. There are many ways of asking questions in Lojban, but some of these
    (like questions about quantity, tense, and emotion) are discussed in other
    chapters.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s13" name="s13">The simplest kind of question is of the type ``Is it true
    that ... '' where some statement follows. This type is called a ``truth question'',
    and can be represented in English by</a> <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d1" name="e13d1">13.1)</a>    Is it true that Fido is a dog?
    Is Fido a dog?
</pre>Note the two formulations. English truth questions can always be formed by
prefixing ``Is is true that'' to the beginning of a statement; there is also usually a
more idiomatic way involving putting the verb before its subject. ``Is Alice a dog?'' is
the truth question corresponding to ``Fido is a dog''. In Lojban, the equivalent
mechanism is to prefix the cmavo ``xu'' (of selma'o UI) to the statement:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    xu la faidon. gerku
    is-it-true-that Fido is-a-dog?
</pre><a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> and <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a> are
equivalent in meaning.

    <p>A truth question can be answered ``yes'' or ``no'', depending on the truth or
    falsity, respectively, of the underlying statement. The standard way of saying
    ``yes'' in Lojban is ``go'i'' and of saying ``no'' is ``nago'i''. (The reasons for
    this rule are explained in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>.) In answer to
    <a href="#e13d2">Example 13.2</a>, the possible answers are:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d3" name="e13d3">13.3)</a>    go'i
    Fido is a dog.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d4" name="e13d4">13.4)</a>    nago'i
    Fido is not a dog.
</pre>Some English questions seemingly have the same form as the truth questions so far
discussed. Consider
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d5" name="e13d5">13.5)</a>    Is Fido a dog or a cat?
</pre>

    <p>Superficially, <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a> seems like a truth question with
    the underlying statement:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    Fido is a dog or a cat.
</pre>

    <p>By translating <a href="#e13d6">Example 13.6</a> into Lojban and prefixing ``xu''
    to signal a truth question, we get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d7" name="e13d7">13.7)</a>    xu la faidon. gerku gi'onai mlatu
    is-it-true-that Fido is-a-dog or is-a-cat
        (but not both)?
</pre>

    <p>Given that Fido really is either a dog or a cat, the appropriate answer would be
    ``go'i''; if Fido were a fish, the appropriate answer would be ``nago'i''.</p>

    <p>But that is not what an English-speaker who utters <a href="#e13d5">Example
    13.5</a> is asking! The true significance of <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a> is
    that the speaker desires to know the truth value of either of the two underlying
    bridi (it is presupposed that only one is true).</p>

    <p>Lojban has an elegant mechanism for rendering this kind of question which is very
    unlike that used in English. Instead of asking about the truth value of the connected
    bridi, Lojban users ask about the truth function which connects them. This is done by
    using a special question cmavo: there is one of these for each of the logical
    connective selma'o, as shown by the following table:</p>
    <pre>
   ge'i    GA  forethought connective question
    gi'i    GIhA    bridi-tail connective question
    gu'i    GUhA    tanru forethought connective question
    je'i    JA  tanru connective question
    ji  A   sumti connective question
</pre>(This list unfortunately departs from the pretty regularity of the other cmavo for
logical connection. The two-syllable selma'o, GIhA and GUhA, make use of the cmavo ending
in ``-i'' which is not used for a truth function, but ``gi'' and ``.i'' were not
available, and different cmavo had to be chosen. This table must simply be memorized,
like most other non-connective cmavo assignments.)

    <p>One correct translation of <a href="#e13d5">Example 13.5</a> employs a question
    gihek:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a>    la .alis gerku gi'i mlatu
    Alice is-a-dog [truth function?] is-a-cat?
</pre>

    <p>Here are some plausible answers:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d9" name="e13d9">13.9)</a>    nagi'e
    Alice is not a dog and is a cat.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d10" name="e13d10">13.10)</a>   gi'enai
    Alice is a dog and is not a cat.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d11" name="e13d11">13.11)</a>   nagi'enai
    Alice is not a dog and is not a cat.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d12" name="e13d12">13.12)</a>   nagi'o
    gi'onai
    Alice is a dog or is a cat but not both
        (I'm not saying which).
</pre><a href="#e13d12">Example 13.12</a> is correct but uncooperative.

    <p>As usual, Lojban questions are answered by filling in the blank left by the
    question. Here the blank is a logical connective, and therefore it is grammatical in
    Lojban to utter a bare logical connective without anything for it to connect.</p>

    <p>The answer ``gi'e'', meaning that Alice is a dog and is a cat, is impossible in
    the real world, but for:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d13" name="e13d13">13.13)</a>  do djica tu'a loi ckafi
        ji loi tcati
    you desire something-about a-mass-of coffee
        [truth function?] a-mass-of tea?
    Do you want coffee or tea?
</pre>the answer ``.e'', meaning that I want both, is perfectly plausible, if not
necessarily polite.

    <p>The forethought questions ``ge'i'' and ``gu'i'' are used like the others, but
    ambiguity forbids the use of isolated forethought connectives as answers --- they
    sound like the start of forethought-connected bridi. So although <a href=
    "#e13d14">Example 13.14</a> is the forethought version of <a href="#e13d13">Example
    13.13</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d14" name="e13d14">13.14)</a>  do djica tu'a
        ge'i loi ckafi
        gi loi tcati
    you desire something-about
        [truth function?] a-mass-of coffee
        [or] a-mass-of tea?
</pre>the answer must be in afterthought form.

    <p>There are natural languages, notably Chinese, which employ the Lojbanic form of
    connective question. The Chinese sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d15" name=
"e13d15">13.15)</a>  ni<sup>3</sup> zou<sup>3</sup> hai<sup>2</sup>shi pao<sup>3</sup>
    you walk [or?] run?
</pre>means ``Do you walk or run?'', and is exactly parallel to the Lojban:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d16" name="e13d16">13.16)</a>  do cadzu gi'i bajra
    you walk [or?] run?
</pre>However, Chinese does not use logical connectives in the reply to such a question,
so the resemblance, though striking, is superficial.

    <p>Truth questions may be used in bridi connection. This form of sentence is
    perfectly legitimate, and can be interpreted by using the convention that a truth
    question is true if the answer is ``yes'' and false if the answer is ``no''.
    Analogously, an imperative sentence (involving the special pro-sumti ``ko'', which
    means ``you'' but marks the sentence as a command) is true if the command is obeyed,
    and false otherwise. A request of Abraham Lincoln's may be translated thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e13d17" name="e13d17">13.17)</a>   ganai ti ckafi
        gi ko bevri loi tcati mi
    .ije ganai ti tcati
        gi ko bevri loi ckafi mi
    If this is-coffee
        then [you!] bring a-mass-of tea to-me,
    and if this is-tea
        then [you!] bring a-mass-of coffee to-me.
    If this is coffee, bring me tea;
        but if this is tea, bring me coffee.
</pre>In logical terms, however, ``but'' is the same as ``and''; the difference is that
the sentence after a ``but'' is felt to be in tension or opposition to the sentence
before it. Lojban represents this distinction by adding the discursive cmavo ``ku'i'' (of
selma'o UI), which is explained in <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>, to the
logical ``.ije''.)

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s14" name="s14">14. Non-logical connectives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s14" name="s14">Way back in</a> <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, the point was
    made that not every use of English ``and'', ``if ... then'', and so on represents a
    Lojban logical connective. In particular, consider the ``and'' of:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d1" name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    John and Alice carried the piano.
</pre>Given the nature of pianos, this probably means that John carried one end and Alice
the other. So it is not true that:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    John carried the piano,
        and Alice carried the piano.
</pre>which would mean that each of them carried the piano by himself/herself. Lojban
deals with this particular linguistic phenomenon as a ``mass''. John and Alice are joined
together into a mass, John-and-Alice, and it is this mass which carried the piano, not
either of them separately. The cmavo ``joi'' (of selma'o JOI) is used to join two or more
components into a mass:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d3" name="e14d3">14.3)</a>    la djan. joi la .alis. cu bevri le pipno
    John massed-with Alice carry the piano.
</pre><a href="#e14d3">Example 14.3</a> covers the case mentioned, where John and Alice
divide the labor; it also could mean that John did all the hauling and Alice did the
supervising. This possibility arises because the properties of a mass are the properties
of its components, which can lead to apparent contradictions: if John is small and Alice
is large, then John-and-Alice is both small and large. Masses are also discussed in
<a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>.

    <p>Grammatically, ``joi'' can appear between two sumti (like an ek) or between two
    tanru components (like a jek). This flexibility must be paid for in the form of
    occasional terminators that cannot be elided:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d4" name="e14d4">14.4)</a>    le nanmu ku joi le ninmu [ku] cu klama le zarci
    The man massed-with the woman go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``ku'' is the elidable terminator for ``le'', which can almost always be
    elided, but not in this case. If the first ``ku'' were elided here, Lojban's parsing
    rules would see ``le nanmu joi'' and assume that another tanru component is to
    follow; since the second ``le'' cannot be part of a tanru, a parsing error results.
    No such problem can occur with logical connectives, because an ek signals a following
    sumti and a jek a following tanru component unambiguously.</p>

    <p>Single or compound cmavo involving members of selma'o JOI are called joiks, by
    analogy with the names for logical connectives. It is not grammatical to use joiks to
    connect bridi-tails.</p>

    <p>In tanru, ``joi'' has the connotation ``mixed with'', as in the following
    example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d5" name="e14d5">14.5)</a>    ti blanu joi xunre bolci
    This is-a-(blue mixed-with red) ball.
    This is a blue and red ball.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ball is neither wholly blue nor wholly red, but partly blue and partly
    red. Its blue/redness is a mass property. (Just how blue something has to be to count
    as ``wholly blue'' is an unsettled question, though. A ``blanu zdani'' may be so even
    though not every part of it is blue.)</p>

    <p>There are several other cmavo in selma'o JOI which can be used in the same
    grammatical constructions. Not all of them are well-defined as yet in all contexts.
    All have clear definitions as sumti connectives; those definitions are shown in the
    following table:</p>
    <pre>
   A joi B     the mass with components A and B
    A ce B      the set with elements A and B
    A ce'o B    the sequence with elements A and B in order
    A sece'o B  the sequence with elements B and A in order
    A jo'u B    A and B considered jointly
    A fa'u B    A and B respectively
    A sefa'u B  B and A respectively
    A jo'e B    the union of sets A and B
    A ku'a B    the intersection of sets A and B
    A pi'u B    the cross product of sets A and B
    A sepi'u B  the cross product of sets B and A
</pre>The cmavo ``se'' is grammatical before any JOI cmavo, but only useful with those
that have inherent order. Here are some examples of joiks:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d6" name="e14d6">14.6)</a>    mi cuxna la .alis. la frank.
        ce la .alis. ce la djeimyz.
    I choose Alice from Frank
        and-member Alice and-member James.
    I choose Alice from among Frank, Alice, and James.
</pre>The x3 place of ``cuxna'' is a set from which the choice is being made. A set is an
abstract object which is determined by specifying its members. Unlike those of a mass,
the properties of a set are unrelated to its members' properties: the set of all rats is
large (since many rats exist), but the rats themselves are small. This chapter does not
attempt to explain set theory (the mathematical study of sets) in detail: explaining
propositional logic is quite enough for one chapter!

    <p>In <a href="#e14d6">Example 14.6</a> we specify that set by listing the members
    with ``ce'' joining them.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d7" name="e14d7">14.7)</a>    ti liste mi ce'o do ce'o la djan.
    This is-a-list-of me and-sequence you and-sequence John.
    This is a list of you, me, and John.
</pre>The x2 place of ``liste'' is a sequence of the things which are mentioned in the
list. (It is worth pointing out that ``lo liste'' means a physical object such as a
grocery list: a purely abstract list is ``lo porsi'', a sequence.) Here the three sumti
connected by ``ce'o'' are in a definite order, not just lumped together in a set or a
mass.

    <p>So ``joi'', ``ce'', and ``ce'o'' are parallel, in that the sumti connected are
    taken to be individuals, and the result is something else: a mass, a set, or a
    sequence respectively. The cmavo ``jo'u'' serves as a fourth element in this pattern:
    the sumti connected are individuals, and the result is still individuals --- but
    inseparably so. The normal Lojban way of saying that James and George are brothers
    is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d8" name="e14d8">14.8)</a>    la djeimyz. bruna la djordj.
    James is-the-brother-of George.
</pre>possibly adding a discursive element meaning ``and vice versa''. However, ``James
and George are brothers'' cannot be correctly translated as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d9" name="e14d9">14.9)</a>    la djeimyz. .e la djordj. bruna
    James and George is-a-brother.
</pre>since that expands to two bridi and means that James is a brother and so is George,
but not necessarily of each other. If the ``.e'' is changed to ``jo'u'', however, the
meaning of <a href="#e14d8">Example 14.8</a> is preserved:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d10" name="e14d10">14.10)</a>  la djeimyz. jo'u la djordj.
        cu remei bruna
    James in-common-with George
        are-a-twosome type-of-brothers.
</pre>

    <p>The tanru ``remei bruna'' is not strictly necessary in this sentence, but is used
    to make clear that we are not saying that James and George are both brothers of some
    third person not specified. Alternatively, we could turn the tanru around: the x1
    place of ``remei'' is a mass with two components, leading to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d11" name="e14d11">14.11)</a>  la djeimyz. joi la djordj.
        cu bruna remei
    James massed-with George
        are-a-brother type-of-twosome.
</pre>where ``joi'' is used to create the necessary mass.

    <p>Likewise, ``fa'u'' can be used to put two individuals together where order
    matters. Typically, there will be another ``fa'u'' somewhere else in the same
    bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d12" name="e14d12">14.12)</a>  la djeimyz. fa'u la djordj.
        prami la meris. fa'u la martas.
    James jointly-in-order-with George
        loves Mary jointly-in-order-with Martha.
    James and George love Mary and Martha, respectively.
</pre>Here the information carried by the English adverb ``respectively'', namely that
James loves Mary and George loves Martha, is divided between the two occurrences of
``fa'u''. If both uses of ``fa'u'' were to be changed to ``.e'', we would get:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e14d13" name="e14d13">14.13)</a>  la djeimyz. .e la djordj.
        prami la meris. .e la martas.
    James and George love Mary and Martha.
</pre>which can be transformed to four bridi:
    <pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s15" name="s15">The final three JOI cmavo, ``jo'e'', ``ku'a'', and
    ``pi'u'', are probably only useful when talking explicitly about sets. They represent
    three standard set operators usually called ``union'', ``intersection'', and ``cross
    product'' (also known as ``Cartesian product''). The union of two sets is a set
    containing all the members that are in either set; the intersection of two sets is a
    set containing all the members that are in both sets. The cross product of two sets
    is the set of all possible ordered pairs, where each ordered pair contains a single
    element from the first set followed by a single element from the second. This may
    seem very abstract; hopefully, the following examples will help:</a></p>

    <p>The following example uses ``se remei'', which is a set (not a mass) of two
    elements:</p>

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d5" name="e15d5">15.5)</a>    la djeimyz. ce[bo] la djordj.

    James and-set George
        cross-product Mary and-set Martha
        are-lover type-of-pairs.
</pre>means that each of the pairs James/Mary, George/Mary, James/Martha, and
George/Martha love each other. Therefore it is similar in meaning to <a href="#e14d13">
    Example 14.13</a>; however, that example speaks only of the men loving the women, not
    vice versa.

    <p>Joiks may be combined with ``bo'' or with ``ke'' in the same way as eks and jeks;
    this allows grouping of non-logical connections between sumti and tanru units, in
    complete parallelism with logical connections:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d6" name="e15d6">15.6)</a>    mi joibo do ce la djan. joibo la djein.

    (I massed-with you) and (John massed-with Jane)
        are-a-mass type-of-two-set
</pre>asserts that there is a set of two items each of which is a mass.

    <p>Non-logical connection is permitted at the joint of a termset; this is useful for
    associating more than one sumti or tagged sumti with each side of the non-logical
    connection. The place structure of ``casnu'' is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>the mass x1 discusses/talks about x2</dd>
    </dl>so the x1 place must be occupied by a mass (for reasons not explained here);
    however, different components of the mass may discuss in different languages. To
    associate each participant with his or her language, we can say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d7" name="e15d7">15.7)</a>     mi ce'e bau la lojban.
        pe'e joi do ce'e bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
    ( I [plus] in-language Lojban
        massed-with you [plus] in-language English ) discuss.
</pre>

    <p>Like all non-logical connectives, the usage shown in <a href="#e15d7">Example
    15.7</a> cannot be mechanically converted into a non-logical connective placed at
    another location in the bridi. The forethought equivalent of <a href="#e15d7">Example
    15.7</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d8" name="e15d8">15.8)</a>     nu'i joigi mi bau la lojban
        gi do bau la gliban. nu'u casnu
</pre>Non-logical forethought termsets are also useful when the things to be
non-logically connected are sumti preceded with tense or modal (BAI) tags:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d9" name="e15d9">15.9)</a>    la djan. fa'u la frank. cusku

        [start termset] in-language Lojban
        [joint] respectively-with
            under-compulsion-by George.
    John and Frank speak in Lojban and under George's
        compulsion, respectively.
</pre><a href="#e14d17">Example 14.17</a> associates speaking in Lojban with John, and
speaking under George's compulsion with Frank. We do not know what language Frank uses,
or whether John speaks under anyone's compulsion.

    <p>Joiks may be prefixed with ``.i'' to produce ijoiks, which serve to non-logically
    connect sentences. The main known use here is ``.ice'o'', which indicates that the
    event of the second bridi follows that of the first bridi in some way other than a
    time relationship (which is handled with a tense):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d10" name="e15d10">15.10)</a>  mi ba gasnu la'edi'e
        .i tu'e kanji lo ni cteki

    I [future] do the-referent-of-the-following:
        ( Compute the quantity of taxes.
        And-then wash the car.
        And-then walkingly-accompany the dog. )
    List of things to do:
        Figure taxes.
        Wash car.
        Walk dog.
</pre><a href="#e15d10">Example 15.10</a> represents a list of things to be done in
priority order. The order is important, hence the need for a sequence connective, but
does not necessarily represent a time order (the dog may end up getting walked first).
Note the use of ``tu'e'' and ``tu'u'' as general brackets around the whole list. This is
related to, but distinct from, their use in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>, because there is
no logical connective between the introductory phrase ``mi ba gasnu la'edi'e'' and the
rest. The brackets effectively show how large an utterance the word ``di'e'', which means
``the following utterance'', refers to.

    <p>The following ``nai'', if present, does not negate either of the things to be
    connected, but instead specifies that some other connection (logical or non-logical)
    is applicable: it is a scalar negation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e15d11" name="e15d11">15.11)</a>  mi jo'unai do cu remei
    I in-common-with [not!] you are-a-twosome
</pre>

    <p>The result of ``mi jo'u do'' would be two individuals, not a mass, therefore
    ``jo'u'' is not applicable; ``joi'' would be the correct connective.</p>

    <p>There is no joik question cmavo as such; however, joiks and ijoiks may be uttered
    in isolation in response to a logical connective question, as in the following
    exchange:</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s16" name="s16">16. Interval connectives and forethought non-logical
    connection</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s16" name="s16">In addition to the non-logical connectives of selma'o JOI
    explained in</a> <a href="#s14">Sections 14</a> and <a href="#s15">15</a>, there are
    three other connectives which can appear in joiks: ``bi'i'', ``bi'o'', and ``mi'i'',
    all of selma'o BIhI. The first two cmavo are used to specify intervals: abstract
    objects defined by two endpoints. The cmavo ``bi'i'' is correct if the endpoints are
    independent of order, whereas ``bi'o'' or ``sebi'o'' are used when order matters.</p>

    <p>An example of ``bi'i'' in sumti connection:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    mi ca sanli
        la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand-on-surface
        Dresden [interval] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt.
</pre>In <a href="#e16d1">Example 16.1</a>, it is all the same whether I am standing
between Dresden and Frankfurt or between Frankfurt and Dresden, so ``bi'i'' is the
appropriate interval connective. The sumti ``la drezdn. bi'i la frankfurt.'' falls into
the x2 place of ``sanli'', which is the surface I stand on; the interval specifies that
surface by its limits. (Obviously, I am not standing on the whole of the interval; the x2
place of ``sanli'' specifies a surface which is typically larger in extent than just the
size of the stander's feet.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a>    mi cadzu ca
        la pacac. bi'o la recac.
    I walk simultaneous-with
        First-hour [ordered-interval] Second-hour.
    I walk from one o'clock to two o'clock.
</pre>In <a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a>, on the other hand, it is essential that ``la
pacac.'' comes before ``la recac.''; otherwise we have an 11-hour (or 23-hour) interval
rather than a one-hour interval. In this use of an interval, the whole interval is
probably intended, or at least most of it.

    <p><a href="#e16d2">Example 16.2</a> is equivalent to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    mi cadzu ca
        la recac. sebi'o la pacac.
    I walk simultaneous-with
        Second-hour [reverse] [ordered] First-hour.
</pre>

    <p>English cannot readily express ``sebi'o'', but its meaning can be understood by
    reversing the two sumti.</p>

    <p>The third cmavo of selma'o BIhI, namely ``mi'i'', expresses an interval seen from
    a different viewpoint: not a pair of endpoints, but a center point and a distance.
    For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d4" name="e16d4">16.4)</a>    le jbama pu daspo la .uacintyn.
        mi'i lo minli be li muno
    the bomb [past] destroys Washington
        [center] what-is measured-in-miles by 50.
    The bomb destroyed Washington and fifty miles around.
</pre>

    <p>Here we have an interval whose center is Washington and whose distance, or radius,
    is fifty miles.</p>

    <p>In <a href="#e16d1">Example 16.1</a>, is it possible that I am standing in Dresden
    (or Frankfurt) itself? Yes. The connectives of selma'o BIhI are ambiguous about
    whether the endpoints themselves are included in or excluded from the interval. Two
    auxiliary cmavo ``ga'o'' and ``ke'i'' (of cmavo GAhO) are used to indicate the status
    of the endpoints: ``ga'o'' means that the endpoint is included, ``ke'i'' that it is
    excluded:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d5" name="e16d5">16.5)</a>    mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ga'o bi'i ga'o la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [inclusive] [interval] [inclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt,
        inclusive of both.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d6" name="e16d6">16.6)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ga'o bi'i ke'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [inclusive] [interval] [exclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (inclusive)
        and Frankfurt (exclusive).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d7" name="e16d7">16.7)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ke'i bi'i ga'o la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [exclusive] [interval] [inclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (exclusive)
        and Frankfurt (inclusive).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d8" name="e16d8">16.8)</a> mi ca sanli la drezdn.
        ke'i bi'i ke'i la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand Dresden
        [exclusive] [interval] [exclusive] Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden and Frankfurt,
        exclusive of both.
</pre>As these examples should make clear, the GAhO cmavo that applies to a given
endpoint is the one that stands physically adjacent to it: the left-hand endpoint is
referred to by the first GAhO, and the right-hand endpoint by the second GAhO. It is
ungrammatical to have just one GAhO.

    <p>(Etymologically, ``ga'o'' is derived from ``ganlo'', which means ``closed'', and
    ``ke'i'' from ``kalri'', which means ``open''. In mathematics, inclusive intervals
    are referred to as closed intervals, and exclusive intervals as open ones.)</p>

    <p>BIhI joiks are grammatical anywhere that other joiks are, including in tanru
    connection and (as ijoiks) between sentences. No meanings have been found for these
    uses.</p>

    <p>Negated intervals, marked with a ``-nai'' following the BIhI cmavo, indicate an
    interval that includes everything but what is between the endpoints (with respect to
    some understood scale):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d9" name="e16d9">16.9)</a>    do dicra .e'a mi ca la daucac. bi'onai la gaicac.
    You disturb (allowed) me at 10 not-from ... to 12
    You can contact me except from 10 to 12.
</pre>

    <p>The complete syntax of joiks is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>[se] JOI [nai] [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO</dd>
    </dl>Notice that the colloquial English translations of ``bi'i'' and ``bi'o'' have
    forethought form: ``between ... and'' for ``bi'i'', and ``from ... to'' for ``bi'o''.
    In Lojban too, non-logical connectives can be expressed in forethought. Rather than
    using a separate selma'o, the forethought logical connectives are constructed from
    the afterthought ones by suffixing ``gi''. Such a compound cmavo is not unnaturally
    called a ``joigik''; the syntax of joigiks is any of:

    <dl>
      <dd>[se] JOI [nai] GI [se] BIhI [nai] GI GAhO [se] BIhI [nai] GAhO GI</dd>
    </dl>Joigiks may be used to non-logically connect bridi, sumti, and bridi-tails; and
    also in termsets.

    <p><a href="#e14d3">Example 14.3</a> in forethought becomes:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d10" name="e16d10">16.10)</a>  joigi la djan. gi la .alis. bevri le pipno
    [Together] John and Alice carry the piano.
</pre>

    <p>The first ``gi'' is part of the joigik; the second ``gi'' is the regular gik that
    separates the two things being connected in all forethought forms.</p>

    <p><a href="#e16d6">Example 16.6</a> can be expressed in forethought as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e16d11" name="e16d11">16.11)</a>  mi ca sanli ke'i bi'i ga'o
        gi la drezdn.
        gi la frankfurt.
    I [present] stand
        [exclusive] between [inclusive] Dresden
        and Frankfurt.
    I am standing between Dresden (exclusive)
        and Frankfurt (inclusive).
</pre>In forethought, unfortunately, the GAhOs become physically separated from the
endpoints, but the same rule applies: the first GAhO refers to the first endpoint.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s17" name="s17">17. Logical and non-logical connectives within
    mekso</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s17" name="s17">Lojban has a separate grammar embedded within the main
    grammar for representing mathematical expressions (or mekso in Lojban) such as ``2 +
    2''. Mathematical expressions are explained fully in</a> <a href=
    "chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>. The basic components of mekso are operands, like
    ``2'', and operators, like ``+''. Both of these may be either logically or
    non-logically connected.</p>

    <p>Operands are connected in afterthought with eks and in forethought with geks, just
    like sumti. Operators, on the other hand, are connected in afterthought with jeks and
    in forethought with guheks, just like tanru components. (However, jeks and joiks with
    ``bo'' are not allowed for operators.) This parallelism is no accident.</p>

    <p>In addition, eks with ``bo'' and with ``ke ... ke'e'' are allowed for grouping
    logically connected operands, and ``ke ... ke'e'' is allowed for grouping logically
    connected operators, although there is no analogue of tanru among the operators.</p>

    <p>Only a few examples of each kind of mekso connection will be given. Despite the
    large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of relatively minor
    importance in either the mekso or the logical-connective scheme of things. These
    examples are drawn from <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>, and contain many
    mekso features not explained in this chapter.</p>

    <p><a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> exhibits afterthought logical connection between
    operands:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d1" name="e17d1">17.1)</a>    vei ci .a vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( three or four ) people go-to the market.
</pre><a href="#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> is equivalent in meaning, but uses forethought
connection:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d2" name="e17d2">17.2)</a>    vei ga ci gi vo [ve'o] prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( either 3 or 4 ) people go-to the market.
</pre>Note that the mekso in <a href="#e17d1">Example 17.1</a> and <a href=
"#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> are being used as quantifiers. Lojban requires that any mekso
other than a simple number be enclosed in ``vei'' and ``ve'o'' parentheses when used as a
quantifier. The right parenthesis mark, ``ve'o'', is an elidable terminator.

    <p>Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A
    contrived example is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d3" name="e17d3">17.3)</a>    li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo
    the-number 2 plus and times 2 equals the-number 4.
    2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre>

    <p>The forethought form of <a href="#e17d3">Example 17.3</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d4" name="e17d4">17.4)</a>    li re ge su'i gi pi'i re
        du li vo
    the-number two both plus and times two
        equals the-number four.
    Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 x 2 = 4.
</pre>Non-logical connection with joiks or joigiks is also permitted between operands and
between operators. One use for this construct is to connect operands with ``bi'i'' to
create mathematical intervals:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d5" name="e17d5">17.5)</a>    li no ga'o bi'i ke'i pa
    the-number zero (inclusive) from-to (exclusive) one
    [0,1)
    the numbers from zero to one,
        including zero but not including one
</pre>You can also combine two operands with ``ce'o'', the sequence connective of selma'o
JOI, to make a compound subscript:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e17d6" name="e17d6">17.6)</a>     xy. boi xi vei by. ce'o dy. [ve'o]
    ``x'' sub ( ``b'' sequence ``d'' )
    $x<sub>b,d</sub>$
</pre>Note that the ``boi'' in <a href="#e17d5">Example 17.5</a> is not elidable, because
the ``xi'' subscript needs something to attach to.

    time cmavo ``pu'', ``ca'', and ``ba'' (of selma'o PU) representing the past, the
    present, and the future respectively. Preceding a selbri, these cmavo state the time
    when the bridi was, is, or will be true (analogous to English verb tenses); preceding
    a sumti, they state that the event of the main bridi is before, simultaneous with, or
    after the event given by the sumti (which is generally a ``le nu'' abstraction;
    see</a> <a href="chapter11.html">Chapter 11</a>).</p>

    <p>The two types of interaction between tenses and logical connectives are logically
    connected tenses and tensed logical connections. The former are fairly simple. Jeks
    may be used between tense cmavo to specify two connected bridi that differ only in
    tense:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d1" name="e18d1">18.1)</a>    la .artr. pu nolraitru
        .ije la .artr. ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] is-a-noblest-governor.
        And Arthur [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
    Arthur was a king, and Arthur will be a king.
</pre>can be reduced to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d2" name="e18d2">18.2)</a>    la .artr. pu je ba nolraitru
    Arthur [past] and [future] is-a-noblest-governor.
    Arthur was and will be king.
</pre><a href="#e18d1">Example 18.1</a> and <a href="#e18d2">Example 18.2</a> are
equivalent in meaning; neither says anything about whether Arthur is king now.

    <p>Non-logical connection with joiks is also possible between tenses:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d3" name="e18d3">18.3)</a>    mi pu bi'o ba vasxu
    I [past] from ... to [future] breathe.
    I breathe from a past time until a future time.
</pre>

    <p>The full tense system makes more interesting tense intervals expressible, such as
    ``from a medium time ago until a long time from now''.</p>

    <p>No forethought connections between tenses are permitted by the grammar, nor is
    there any way to override the default left-grouping rule; these limitations are
    imposed to keep the tense grammar simpler. Whatever can be said with tenses or modals
    can be said with subordinate bridi stating the time, place, or mode explicitly, so it
    is reasonable to try to remove at least some complications.</p>

    <p>Tensed logical connections are both more complex and more important than logical
    connections between tenses. Consider the English sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d4" name="e18d4">18.4)</a>    I went to the market, and I bought food.
</pre>

    <p>The verbatim translation of <a href="#e18d4">Example 18.4</a>, namely:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d5" name="e18d5">18.5)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci .ije mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] go-to the market. And I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre>fails to fully represent a feature of the English, namely that the buying came
after the going. (It also fails to represent that the buying was a consequence of the
going, which can be expressed by a modal that is discussed in <a href="chapter9.html">
    Chapter 9</a>.) However, the tense information --- that the event of my going to the
    market preceded the event of my buying food --- can be added to the logical
    connective as follows. The ``.ije'' is replaced by ``.ijebo'', and the tense cmavo
    ``ba'' is inserted between ``.ije'' and ``bo'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d6" name="e18d6">18.6)</a>    mi pu klama le zarci
        .ijebabo mi pu tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] go-to the market.
        And [later] I [past] buy items-of food.
</pre>

    <p>Here the ``pu'' cmavo in the two bridi-tails express the time of both actions with
    respect to the speaker: in the past. The ``ba'' relates the two items to one another:
    the second item is later than the first item. The grammar does not permit omitting
    the ``bo''; if it were omitted, the ``ba'' and the second ``pu'' would run together
    to form a compound tense ``bapu'' applying to the second bridi-tail only.</p>

    <p>Adding tense or modal information to a logical connective is permitted only in the
    following situations:</p>

    <p>Between an ek (or joik) and ``bo'', as in:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d7" name="e18d7">18.7)</a>    la .djan .ecabo la .alis. klama le zarci
    John and [simultaneous] Alice go-to the market.
    John and Alice go to the market simultaneously.
</pre>Between an ek (or joik) and ``ke'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d8" name="e18d8">18.8)</a>    mi dzukla le zarci
        .epuke le zdani .a le ckule [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market
        and [earlier] ( the house or the school ).
    I walk to the market and,
        before that, to the house or the school.
</pre>Between a gihek and ``bo'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d9" name="e18d9">18.9)</a>    mi dunda le cukta
        gi'ebabo lebna lo rupnu vau do
    I give the book
        and [later] take some currency-units from/to you.
    I give you the book and then take some dollars
        (pounds, yen) from you.
</pre>Between a gihek and ``ke'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d10" name="e18d10">18.10)</a>  mi dzukla le zarci
        gi'ecake cusku zo'e la djan. [ke'e]
    I walk-to the market
        and [simultaneous] express something to-John.
    I walk to the market and at the same time talk to John.
</pre>Between an ijek (or ijoik) and ``bo'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d11" name="e18d11">18.11)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu .ijebabo mi viska pa ninmu
    I see a man. And [later] I see a woman.
    I see a man, and then I see a woman.
</pre>Between an ijek (or ijoik) and ``tu'e'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d12" name="e18d12">18.12)</a>  mi viska pa nanmu
        .ijebatu'e mi viska pa ninmu [tu'u]
    I see a man.
        And [later] I see a woman.
    I see a man, and then I see a woman.
</pre>And finally, between a jek (or joik) and ``bo'', as in:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d13" name="e18d13">18.13)</a>  mi mikce jebabo ricfu
    I-am-a doctor and [later] rich
    I am a doctor and future rich person.
</pre>As can be seen from <a href="#e18d11">Example 18.11</a> and <a href=
"#e18d12">Example 18.12</a>, the choice between ``bo'' and ``ke'' (or ``tu'e'') is
arbitrary when there are only two things to be connected. If there were no tense
information to include, of course neither would be required; it is only the rule that
tense information must always be sandwiched between the logical connective and a
following ``bo'', ``ke'', or ``tu'e'' that requires the use of one of these grouping
cmavo in <a href="#e18d7">Example 18.7</a> and <a href="#e18d9">Examples 18.9</a> through
<a href="#e18d13">18.13</a>.

    <p>Non-logical connectives with ``bo'' and ``ke'' can include tense information in
    exactly the same way as logical connectives. Forethought connectives, however (except
    as noted below) are unable to do so, as are termsets or tense connectives.
    Mathematical operands and operators can also include tense information in their
    logical connectives as a result of their close parallelism with sumti and tanru
    components respectively:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d14" name="e18d14">18.14)</a>  vei ci .ebabo vo [ve'o] tadni cu zvati le kumfa
    ( 3 and [future] 4 ) students are-at the room.
    Three and, later, four students were in the room.
</pre>is a simple example. There is a special grammatical rule for use when a tense
applies to both of the selbri in a forethought bridi-tail connection: the entire
forethought construction can just be preceded by a tense. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e18d15" name="e18d15">18.15)</a>  mi pu ge klama le zarci gi tervecnu lo cidja
    I [past] both go-to the market and buy some food
    I went to the market and bought some food.
</pre><a href="#e18d15">Example 18.15</a> is similar to <a href="#e18d5">Example
18.5</a>. There is no time relationship specified between the going and the buying; both
are simply set in the past.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s19" name="s19">19. Abstractor connection and connection within
    abstractions</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-s19" name="s19">Last and (as a matter of fact) least: a logical connective
    is allowed between abstraction markers of selma'o NU. As usual, the connection can be
    expanded to a bridi connection between two bridi which differ only in abstraction
    marker. Jeks are the appropriate connective.</a> <a href="#e19d1">Example 19.1</a>
    and <a href="#e19d2">Example 19.2</a> are equivalent in meaning:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e19d1" name="e19d1">19.1)</a>    le ka la frank. ciska cu xlali
        .ije le ni la frank. ciska cu xlali

        and the quantity of Frank's writing is bad.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e19d2" name="e19d2">19.2)</a> le ka je ni la frank. ciska cu xlali
    The quality and quantity of Frank's writing is bad.
</pre>As with tenses and modals, there is no forethought and no way to override the
left-grouping rule.

    <p>Logical connectives and abstraction are related in another way as well, though.
    Since an abstraction contains a bridi, the bridi may have a logical connection inside
    it. Is it legitimate to split the outer bridi into two, joined by the logical
    connection? Absolutely not. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e19d3" name="e19d3">19.3)</a>    mi jinvi le du'u loi jmive cu zvati
        gi'onai na zvati vau la .iupiter.
    I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things (is-at
        or-else isn't-at) Jupiter.
    I believe there either is or isn't life on Jupiter.
</pre>is true, since the embedded sentence is a tautology, but:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-14-e19d4" name="e19d4">19.4)</a>    mi jinvi le du'u loi jmive

    I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things
        is-at Jupiter
    or-else I opine the fact-that a-mass-of living-things
        isn't-at Jupiter
</pre>is false, since I have no evidence one way or the other (``jinvi'' requires some
sort of evidence, real or fancied, unlike ``krici'').

      ``No'' Problems: On Lojban Negation</h1><!--
      <h5>$Revision: 4.1 $<br />
      mkhtml: 1.1</h5>
      -->
    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s1" name="s1">The grammatical expression of negation is a critical part of
    Lojban's claim to being logical. The problem of negation, simply put, is to come up
    with a complete definition of the word ``not''. For Lojban's unambiguous grammar,
    this means further that meanings of ``not'' with different grammatical effect must be
    different words, and even different grammatical structures.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s1" name="s1">Logical assertions are implicitly required in a logical
    language; thus, an apparatus for expressing them is built into Lojban's logical
    connectives and other structures.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s1" name="s1">In natural languages, especially those of Indo-European
    grammar, we have sentences composed of two parts which are typically called
    ``subject'' and ``predicate''. In the statement</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  John goes to the store
</pre>``John'' is the subject, and ``goes to the store'' is the predicate. Negating
<a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> to produce
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>  John doesn't go to the store.
</pre>has the effect of declaring that the predicate does not hold for the subject.
<a href="#e1d2">Example 1.2</a> says nothing about whether John goes somewhere else, or
whether someone else besides John goes to the store.

    <p>We will call this kind of negation ``natural language negation''. This kind of
    negation is difficult to manipulate by the tools of logic, because it doesn't always
    follow the rules of logic. Logical negation is bi-polar: either a statement is true,
    or it is false. If a statement is false, then its negation must be true. Such
    negation is termed contradictory negation.</p>

    <p>Let's look at some examples of how natural language negation can violate the rules
    of contradictory negation.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d3" name="e1d3">1.3)</a>  Some animals are not white.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>   Some animals are white.
</pre>

    <p>Both of these statements are true; yet one is apparently the negation of the
    other. Another example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>  I mustn't go to the dance.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>   I must go to the dance.
</pre>

    <p>At first thought, <a href="#e1d5">Example 1.5</a> negates <a href="#e1d6">Example
    1.6</a>. Thinking further, we realize that there is an intermediate state wherein I
    am permitted to go to the dance, but not obligated to do so. Thus, it is possible
    that both statements are false.</p>

    <p>Sometimes order is significant:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d7" name="e1d7">1.7)</a>  The falling rock didn't kill Sam.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d8" name="e1d8">1.8)</a>   Sam wasn't killed by the falling rock.
</pre>

    <p>Our minds play tricks on us with this one. Because <a href="#e1d7">Example 1.7</a>
    is written in what is called the ``active voice'', we immediately get confused about
    whether ``the falling rock'' is a suitable subject for the predicate ``did kill
    Sam''. ``Kill'' implies volition to us, and rocks do not have volition. This
    confusion is employed by opponents of gun control who use the argument ``Guns don't
    kill people; people kill people.''</p>

    <p>Somehow, we don't have the same problem with <a href="#e1d8">Example 1.8</a>. The
    subject is Sam, and we determine the truth or falsity of the statement by whether he
    was or wasn't killed by the falling rock.</p>

    <p><a href="#e1d8">Example 1.8</a> also helps us focus on the fact that there are at
    least two questionable facts implicit in this sentence: whether Sam was killed, and
    if so, whether the falling rock killed him. If Sam wasn't killed, the question of
    what killed him is moot.</p>

    <p>This type of problem becomes more evident when the subject of the sentence turns
    out not to exist:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d9" name="e1d9">1.9)</a>  The King of Mexico didn't come to dinner.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e1d10" name="e1d10">1.10)</a> The King of Mexico did come to dinner.
</pre>

    <p>In the natural languages, we would be inclined to say that both of these
    statements are false, since there is no King of Mexico.</p>

    <p>The rest of this chapter is designed to explain the Lojban model of negation.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s2" name="s2">2. bridi negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s2" name="s2">In discussing Lojban negation, we will call the form of
    logical negation that simply denies the truth of a statement ``bridi negation''.
    Using bridi negation, we can say the equivalent of ``I haven't stopped beating my
    wife'' without implying that I ever started, nor even that I have a wife, meaning
    simply ``It isn't true that I have stopped beating my wife.'' Since Lojban uses bridi
    as smaller components of complex sentences, bridi negation is permitted in these
    components as well at the sentence level.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s2" name="s2">For the bridi negation of a sentence to be true, the sentence
    being negated must be false. A major use of bridi negation is in making a negative
    response to a yes/no question; such responses are usually contradictory, denying the
    truth of the entire sentence. A negative answer to</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s2" name="s2"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  Did you go to the store?
</pre>is taken as a negation of the entire sentence, equivalent to
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  No, I didn't go to the store.
</pre>

    <p>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its
    negation is false, and vice versa.</p>

    <p>The simplest way to express a bridi negation is to use the cmavo ``na'' of selma'o
    NA before the selbri of the affirmative form of the bridi (but after the ``cu'', if
    there is one):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go-to the store.
</pre>when negated becomes:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  mi na klama le zarci
    I [false] go-to the store.
</pre>

    <p>Note that we have used a special convention to show in the English that a bridi
    negation is present. We would like to use the word ``not'', because this highlights
    the naturalness of putting the negation marker just before the selbri, and makes the
    form easier to learn. But there is a major difference between Lojban's bridi negation
    with ``na'' and natural language negation with ``not''. In English, the word ``not''
    can apply to a single word, to a phrase, to an English predicate, or to the entire
    sentence. In addition, ``not'' may indicate either contradictory negation or another
    form of negation, depending on the sentence. Lojban's internal bridi negation, on the
    other hand, always applies to an entire bridi, and is always a contradictory
    negation; that is, it contradicts the claim of the whole bridi.</p>

    <p>Because of the ambiguity of English ``not'', we will use ``[false]'' in the
    translation of Lojban examples to remind the reader that we are expressing a
    contradictory negation. Here are more examples of bridi negation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  mi [cu] na ca klama le zarci
    I [false] now am-a-go-er to the market.
    I am not going to the market now.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>   lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e cu na krecau
    The-actual present noblest-governor
        of the French country [false] is-hair-without.
    The current king of France isn't bald.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>   ti na barda prenu co melbi mi
    This [false] is a big-person of-type (beautiful to me).
    This isn't a big person who is beautiful to me.
</pre>

    <p>Although there is this fundamental difference between Lojban's internal bridi
    negation and English negation, we note that in many cases, especially when there are
    no existential or quantified variables (the cmavo ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' of
    selma'o KOhA, explained in <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>) in the bridi, you
    can indeed translate Lojban ``na'' as ``not'' (or ``isn't'' or ``doesn't'', as
    appropriate).</p>

    <p>The most important rule about bridi negation is that if a bridi is true, its
    negation is false, and vice versa.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, there are several structures that implicitly contain bridi, so that
    Lojban sentences may contain more than one occurrence of ``na''. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  mi na gleki le nu
        na klama le nu dansu
    I [false] am-happy-about the event-of(
        [false] going-to the event-of dancing).
    It is not the case that I am happy about it not being
        the case that I am going to the dance.
    I am not happy about not going to the dance.
In the previous example, we used internal negations in abstraction
bridi; bridi negation may also be found in descriptions within
sumti.  For example:

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d9" name="e2d9">2.9)</a>   mi nelci le na melbi
    I am fond of the-one-described-as ([false] beautiful)
    I am fond of the one who isn't beautiful.
</pre>

    <p>A more extreme (and more indefinite) example is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d10" name="e2d10">2.10)</a>    mi nelci lo na ca nolraitru
        be le frasygu'e
    I am-fond-of one-who-is ([false] the current king
        of the French-country).
    I am fond of one who isn't the current king of France.
</pre>

    <p>The claim of <a href="#e2d10">Example 2.10</a> could apply to anyone except a
    person who is fond of no one at all, since the relation within the description is
    false for everyone. You cannot readily express these situations in colloquial
    English.</p>

    <p>Negation with ``na'' applies to an entire bridi, and not to just part of a selbri.
    Therefore, you won't likely have reason to put ``na'' inside a tanru. In fact, the
    grammar currently does not allow you to do so (except in a lujvo and in elaborate
    constructs involving GUhA, the forethought connector for selbri). Any situation where
    you might want to do so can be expressed in a less-compressed non-tanru form. This
    grammatical restriction helps ensure that bridi negation is kept separate from other
    forms of negation.</p>

    <p>The grammar of ``na'' allows multiple adjacent negations, which cancel out, as in
    normal logic:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d11" name="e2d11">2.11)</a>    ti na na barda prenu co
        melbi mi
    This [false] [false] is-a-big person
        that is (beautiful to me).
</pre>which is the same as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d12" name="e2d12">2.12)</a>    ti barda prenu co melbi mi
    This is a big-person that is (beautiful to me).
</pre>

    <p>When a selbri is tagged with a tense or a modal, negation with ``na'' is permitted
    in two positions: before or after the tag. No semantic difference between these forms
    has yet been defined, but this is not finally determined, since the interactions
    between tenses/modals and bridi negation have not been fully explored. In particular,
    it remains to be seen whether sentences using less familiar tenses, such as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d13" name="e2d13">2.13)</a>    mi [cu] ta'e klama le zarci
    I habitually go to the market.
</pre>mean the same thing with ``na'' before the ``ta'e'', as when the negation occurs
afterwards; we'll let future, Lojban-speaking, logicians decide on how they relate to
each other.

    <p>A final caution on translating English negations into Lojban: if you translate the
    English literally, you'll get the wrong one. With English causal statements, and
    other statements with auxiliary clauses, this problem is more likely.</p>

    <p>Thus, if you translate the English:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d14" name=
"e2d14">2.14)</a>    I do not go to the market because the car is broken.
</pre>as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d15" name="e2d15">2.15)</a>    mi na klama le zarci ki'u lenu le karce cu spofu
    I [false] go-to the market because the car is broken.
    It is false that: ``I go to the market because the car
        is broken.''
</pre>you end up negating too much.

    <p>Such mistranslations result from the ambiguity of English compounded by the
    messiness of natural language negation. A correct translation of the normal
    interpretation of <a href="#e2d14">Example 2.14</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d16" name="e2d16">2.16)</a>    lenu mi na klama le zarci
        cu se krinu
            lenu le karce cu spofu
    The event-of (my [false] going-to the market)
        is justified by
            the event-of (the car being broken).
    My not going to the market is because the car is broken.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e2d16">Example 2.16</a>, the negation is clearly confined to the
    event abstraction in the x1 sumti, and does not extend to the whole sentence. The
    English could also have been expressed by two separate sentences joined by a causal
    connective (which we'll not go into here).</p>

    <p>The problem is not confined to obvious causals. In the English:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d17" name=
"e2d17">2.17)</a>    I was not conscripted into the Army with the help of
        my uncle the Senator.
</pre>we do not intend the uncle's help to be part of the negation. We must thus move the
negation into an event clause or use two separate sentences. The event-clause version
would look like:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e2d18" name="e2d18">2.18)</a>    The event-of (my [false] being-conscripted-into
        the Army) was aided by my uncle the Senator.
</pre>

    <p>It is possible that someone will want to incorporate bridi negations into lujvo.
    For this reason, the rafsi ``-nar-'' has been reserved for ``na''. However, before
    using this rafsi, make sure that you intend the contradictory bridi negation, and not
    the scalar negation described in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a>, which will be much more
    common in tanru and lujvo.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s3" name="s3">3. Scalar Negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s3" name="s3">Let us now consider some other types of negation. For
    example, when we say:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s3" name="s3"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  The chair is not brown.
</pre>we make a positive inference --- that the chair is some other color. Thus, it is
legitimate to respond:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  It is green.
</pre>

    <p>Whether we agree that the chair is brown or not, the fact that the statement
    refers to color has significant effect on how we interpret some responses. If we hear
    the following exchange:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  The chair is not brown.
    Correct.  The chair is wooden.
</pre>we immediately start to wonder about the unusual wood that isn't brown. If we hear
the exchange:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  Is the chair green?
    No, it is in the kitchen.
</pre>we are unsettled because the response seems to be a non-sequitur. But since it
might be true and it is a statement about the chair, one can't say it is entirely
irrelevant!

    <p>What is going on in these statements is something called ``scalar negation''. As
    the name suggests, scalar negation presumes an implied scale. A negation of this type
    not only states that one scalar value is false, but implies that another value on the
    scale must be true. This can easily lead to complications. The following exchange
    seems reasonably natural (a little suspension of disbelief in such inane conversation
    will help):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  That isn't a blue house.
    Right! That is a green house.
</pre>

    <p>We have acknowledged a scalar negation by providing a correct value which is
    another color in the set of colors permissible for houses. While a little less
    likely, the following exchange is also natural:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  That isn't a blue house.
    Right! That is a blue car.
</pre>

    <p>Again, we have acknowledged a scalar negation, and substituted a different object
    in the universe of discourse of things that can be blue.</p>

    <p>Now, if the following exchange occurs:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  That isn't a blue house.
    Right! That is a green car.
</pre>we find the result unsettling. This is because it seems that two corrections have
been applied when there is only one negation. Yet out of context, ``blue house'' and
``green car'' seem to be reasonably equivalent units that should be mutually replaceable
in a sentence. It's just that we don't have a clear way in English to say:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>  That isn't a ``blue-house''.
</pre>aloud so as to clearly imply that the scalar negation is affecting the pair of
words as a single unit.

    <p>Another even more confusing example of scalar negation is to the sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  John didn't go to Paris from Rome.
</pre>

    <p>Might <a href="#e3d9">Example 3.9</a> imply that John went to Paris from somewhere
    else? Or did he go somewhere else from Rome? Or perhaps he didn't go anywhere at all:
    maybe someone else did, or maybe there was no event of going whatsoever. One can
    devise circumstances where any one, two or all three of these statements might be
    inferred by a listener.</p>

    <p>In English, we have a clear way of distinguishing scalar negation from predicate
    negation that can be used in many situations. We can use the partial word ``non-'' as
    a prefix. But this is not always considered good usage, even though it would render
    many statements much clearer. For example, we can clearly distinguish</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d10" name="e3d10">3.10)</a>    That is a non-blue house.
</pre>from the related sentence
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d11" name="e3d11">3.11)</a>    That is a blue non-house.
</pre><a href="#e3d10">Example 3.10</a> and <a href="#e3d11">Example 3.11</a> have the
advantage that, while they contain a negative indication, they are in fact positive
assertions. They say what is true by excluding the false; they do not say what is false.

    <p>We can't always use ``non-'' though, because of the peculiarities of English's
    grammar. It would sound strange to say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d12" name="e3d12">3.12)</a>    John went to non-Paris from Rome.
</pre>or
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d13" name="e3d13">3.13)</a>    John went to Paris from non-Rome.
</pre>although these would clarify the vague negation. Another circumlocution for English
scalar negation is ``other than'', which works where ``non-'' does not, but is wordier.

    <p>Finally, we have natural language negations that are called polar negations, or
    opposites:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d14" name="e3d14">3.14)</a>    John is moral

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e3d15" name="e3d15">3.15)</a> John is immoral
</pre>

    <p>To be immoral is much more than to just be not moral: it implies the opposite
    condition. Statements like <a href="#e3d15">Example 3.15</a> are strong negations
    which not only deny the truth of a statement, but assert its opposite. Since,
    ``opposite'' implies a scale, polar negations are a special variety of scalar
    negations.</p>

    <p>To examine this concept more closely, let us draw a linear scale, showing two
    examples of how the scale is used:</p>
    <pre>
   Affirmations (positive)      Negations (negative)
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
    All       Most        Some         Few       None
    Excellent Good        Fair         Poor     Awful
</pre>

    <p>Some scales are more binary than the examples we diagrammed. Thus we have ``not
    necessary'' or ``unnecessary'' being the polar opposite of necessary. Another scale,
    especially relevant to Lojban, is interpreted based on situations modified by one's
    philosophy: ``not true'' may be equated with ``false'' in a bi-valued
    truth-functional logic, while in tri-valued logic an intermediate between ``true''
    and ``false'' is permitted, and in fuzzy logic a continuous scale exists from true to
    false. The meaning of ``not true'' requires a knowledge of which variety of truth
    scale is being considered.</p>

    <p>We will define the most general form of scalar negation as indicating only that
    the particular point or value in the scale or range is not valid and that some other
    (unspecified) point on the scale is correct. This is the intent expressed in most
    contexts by ``not mild''.</p>

    <p>Using this paradigm, contradictory negation is less restrictive than scalar
    negation --- it says that the point or value stated is incorrect (false), and makes
    no statement about the truth of any other point or value, whether or not on the
    scale.</p>

    <p>In English, scalar negation semantically includes phrases such as ``other than'',
    ``reverse of'', or ``opposite from'' expressions and their equivalents. More
    commonly, scalar negation is expressed in English by the prefixes ``non-'', ``un-'',
    ``il-'', and ``im-''. Just which form and permissible values are implied by a scalar
    negation is dependent on the semantics of the word or concept which is being negated,
    and on the context. Much confusion in English results from the uncontrolled
    variations in meaning of these phrases and prefixes.</p>

    <p>In the examples of <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>, we will translate the general case
    of scalar negation using the general formula ``other than'' when a phrase is
    scalar-negated, and ``non-'' when a single word is scalar-negated.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s4" name="s4">4. selbri and tanru negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s4" name="s4">All the scalar negations illustrated in</a> <a href=
    "#s3">Section 3</a> are expressed in Lojban using the cmavo ``na'e'' (of selma'o
    NAhE). The most common use of ``na'e'' is as a prefix to the selbri:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I go to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>   mi na'e klama le zarci
    I non-go to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Comparing these two, we see that the negation operator being used in <a href=
    "#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> is ``na'e''. But what exactly does ``na'e'' negate? Does the
    negation include only the gismu ``klama'', which is the entire selbri in this case,
    or does it include the ``le zarci'' as well? In Lojban, the answer is unambiguously
    ``only the gismu''. The cmavo ``na'e'' always applies only to what follows it.</p>

    <p><a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a> looks as if it were parallel to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  mi na klama le zarci
    I [false] go-to the market.
</pre>but in fact there is no real parallelism at all. A negation using ``na'' denies the
truth of a relationship, but a selbri negation with ``na'e'' asserts that a relationship
exists other than that stated, one which specifically involves the sumti identified in
the statement. The grammar allotted to ``na'e'' allows us to unambiguously express scalar
negations in terms of scope, scale, and range within the scale. Before we explain the
scalar aspects, let us show how the scope of ``na'e'' is determined.

    <p>In tanru, we may wish to negate an individual element before combining it with
    another to form the tanru. We in effect need a shorter-than-selbri-scope negation,
    for which we can use ``na'e'' as well. The positive sentence</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  mi cadzu klama le zarci
    I walking-ly go to the market.
</pre>can be subjected to selbri negation in several ways. Two are:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  mi na'e cadzu klama le zarci
    I (other-than-walkingly)-go-to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>   mi cadzu na'e klama le zarci
    I walkingly-(other-than-go-to) the market.

    <p>These negations show the default scope of ``na'e'' is close-binding on an
    individual brivla in a tanru. <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> says that I am going to
    the market, but in some kind of a non-walking manner. (As with most tanru, there are
    a few other possible interpretations, but we'll assume this one --- see <a href=
    "chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a> for a discussion of tanru meaning).</p>

    <p>In neither <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> nor <a href="#e4d6">Example 4.6</a>
    does the ``na'e'' negate the entire selbri. While both sentences contain negations
    that deny a particular relationship between the sumti, they also have a component
    which makes a positive claim about such a relationship. This is clearer in <a href=
    "#e4d5">Example 4.5</a>, which says that I am going, but in a non-walking manner. In
    <a href="#e4d6">Example 4.6</a>, we have claimed that the relationship between me and
    the market in some way involves walking, but is not one of ``going to'' (perhaps we
    are walking around the market, or walking-in-place while at the market).</p>

    <p>The ``scale'', or actually the ``set'', implied in Lojban tanru negations is
    anything which plausibly can be substituted into the tanru. (Plausibility here is
    interpreted in the same way that answers to a ``mo'' question must be plausible ---
    the result must not only have the right number of places and have sumti values
    appropriate to the place structure, it must also be appropriate or relevant to the
    context.) This minimal condition allows a speaker to be intentionally vague, while
    still communicating meaningful information. The speaker who uses selbri negation is
    denying one relationship, while minimally asserting a different relationship.</p>

    <p>We also need a scalar negation form that has a scope longer than a single brivla.
    There exists such a longer-scope selbri negation form, as exemplified by (each Lojban
    sentence in the next several examples is given twice, with parentheses in the second
    copy showing the scope of the ``na'e''):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  mi na'eke cadzu klama [ke'e] le zarci
    mi na'e (ke cadzu klama [ke'e]) le zarci
    I other-than-(walkingly-go-to) the market.
</pre>

    <p>This negation uses the same ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' delimiters (the ``ke'e'' is always
    elidable at the end of a selbri) that are used in tanru. The sentence clearly negates
    the entire selbri. The ``ke'e'', whether elided or not, reminds us that the negation
    does not include the trailing sumti. While the trailing-sumti place-structure is
    defined as that of the final brivla, the trailing sumti themselves are not part of
    the selbri and are thus not negated by ``na'e''.</p>

    <p>Negations of just part of the selbri are also permitted:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d8" name="e4d8">4.8)</a>  mi na'eke sutra cadzu ke'e klama le zarci
    mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu ke'e) klama le zarci
    I other-than-(quickly-walkingly) go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e4d8">Example 4.8</a>, only the ``sutra cadzu'' tanru is negated, so
    the speaker is indeed going to the market, but not by walking quickly.</p>

    <p>Negations made with ``na'e'' or ``na'eke'' also include within their scope any
    sumti attached to the brivla or tanru with ``be'' or ``bei''. Such attached sumti are
    considered part of the brivla or tanru:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d9" name="e4d9">4.9)</a>  mi na'e ke sutra cadzu be le mi birka ke'e
        klama le zarci
    I other-than-(quickly walking-on-my-arms-ly)
        go-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Note that <a href="#e4d10">Example 4.10</a> and <a href="#e4d11">Example 4.11</a>
    do not express the same thing:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d10" name="e4d10">4.10)</a>    mi na'eke sutra cadzu [ke'e] lemi birka
    mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu [ke'e]) lemi birka
    I other-than-(quickly-walk-on) my-arms.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d11" name="e4d11">4.11)</a> mi na'eke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke'e]
    mi na'e (ke sutra cadzu be lemi birka [ke'e])
    I other-than-(quickly-walk-on my-arms).
</pre>

    <p>The translations show that the negation in <a href="#e4d10">Example 4.10</a> is
    more restricted in scope; i.e. less of the sentence is negated with respect to x1
    (``mi'').</p>

    <p>Logical scope being an important factor in Lojban's claims to be unambiguous, let
    us indicate the relative precedence of ``na'e'' as an operator. Grouping with ``ke''
    and ``ke'e'', of course, has an overt scope, which is its advantage. ``na'e'' is very
    close binding to its brivla. Internal binding of tanru, with ``bo'', is not as
    tightly bound as ``na'e''. ``co'', the tanru inversion operator has a scope that is
    longer than all other tanru constructs.</p>

    <p>In short, ``na'e'' and ``na'eke'' define a type of negation, which is shorter in
    scope than bridi negation, and which affects all or part of a selbri. The result of
    ``na'e'' negation remains an assertion of some specific truth and not merely a denial
    of another claim.</p>

    <p>The similarity becomes striking when it is noticed that the rafsi ``-nal-'',
    representing ``na'e'' when a tanru is condensed into a lujvo, forms an exact parallel
    to the English usage of ``non-''. Turning a series of related negations into lujvo
    gives:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d12" name="e4d12">4.12)</a>    na'e klama becomes nalkla
    na'e cadzu klama becomes naldzukla
    na'e sutra cadzu klama becomes nalsu'adzukla
    nake sutra cadzu ke'e klama becomes nalsu'adzuke'ekla
</pre>

    <p>Note: ``-kem-'' is the rafsi for ``ke'', but it is omitted in the final lujvo as
    superfluous --- ``ke'e'' is its own rafsi, and its inclusion in the lujvo implies a
    ``ke'' after the ``-nal-'', since it needs to close something; only a ``ke''
    immediately after the negation would make the ``ke'e'' meaningful in the tanru
    expressed in this lujvo.</p>

    <p>In a lujvo, it is probably clearest to translate ``-nal-'' as ``non-'', to match
    the English combining forms, except when the ``na'e'' has single word scope and
    English uses ``un-'' or ``im-'' to negate that single word. Translation style should
    determine the use of ``other than'', ``non-'', or another negator for ``na'e'' in
    tanru; the translator must render the Lojban into English so it is clear in context.
    Let's go back to our simplest example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d13" name="e4d13">4.13)</a>    mi na'e klama le zarci
    I am other-than-(going-to) the market.
    ?I am not going-to the market.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d14" name="e4d14">4.14)</a> mi nalkla le zarci
    I am-a-non-go-er-to the market.
</pre>

    <p>Note that to compare with the English translation form using ``non-'', we've
    translated the Lojban as if the selbri were a noun. Since Lojban ``klama'' is
    indifferently a noun, verb, or adjective, the difference is purely a translation
    change, not a true change in meaning. The English difference seems significant,
    though, due to the strongly different English grammatical forms and the ambiguity of
    English negation.</p>

    <p>Consider the following highly problematic sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d15" name="e4d15">4.15)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e
        cu krecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-hair-without.
    The current King of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>The selbri ``krecau'' negates with ``na'e'' as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d16" name="e4d16">4.16)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e
        cu na'e krecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-other-than hair-without.
    The current King of France is other-than-bald.
</pre>or, as a lujvo:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d17" name="e4d17">4.17)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e
        cu nalkrecau
    An-actual currently noblest-governor
        of the French country
        is-non-hair-without.
    The current King of France is a non-bald-one.
</pre><a href="#e4d16">Example 4.16</a> and <a href="#e4d17">Example 4.17</a> express the
predicate negation forms using a negation word (``na'e'') or rafsi (``-nal-''); yet they
make positive assertions about the current King of France; ie., that he is
other-than-bald or non-bald. This follows from the close binding of ``na'e'' to the
brivla. The lujvo form makes this overt by absorbing the negative marker into the word.

    <p>Since there is no current King of France, it is false to say that he is bald, or
    non-bald, or to make any other affirmative claim about him. Any sentence about the
    current King of France containing only a selbri negation is as false as the sentence
    without the negation. No amount of selbri negations have any effect on the truth
    value of the sentence, which is invariably ``false'', since no affirmative statement
    about the current King of France can be true. On the other hand, bridi negation does
    produce a truth:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e4d18" name="e4d18">4.18)</a>    lo ca nolraitru
        be le fasygu'e
        cu na krecau
    An-actual current noblest-governor
        of the French Country
        [false] is-hair-without.
    It is false that the current King of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>Note: ``lo'' is used in these sentences because negation relates to truth
    conditions. To meaningfully talk about truth conditions in sentences carrying a
    description, it must be clear that the description actually applies to the referent.
    A sentence using ``le'' instead of ``lo'' can be true even if there is no current
    king of France, as long as the speaker and the listener agree to describe something
    as the current king of France. (See the explanations of ``le'' in <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s5" name="s5">5. Expressing scales in selbri negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s5" name="s5">In expressing a scalar negation, we must provide some
    indication of the scale, range, frame-of-reference, or universe of discourse that is
    being dealt with in an assertion. As stated in</a> <a href="#s4">Section 4</a>, the
    default is the set of plausible alternatives. Thus if we say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
    The chair is a non-(red-thing).
</pre>the pragmatic interpretation is that we mean a different color and not
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le stizu cu dzukla be le zarci
    The chair walkingly-goes-to-the-market.
</pre>

    <p>However, if we have reason to be more explicit (an obtuse or contrary listener, or
    simply an overt logical analysis), we can clarify that we are referring to a color by
    saying:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre skari
    The chair is of a non-(red)-color
        (as perceived by something under some conditions).
</pre>

    <p>We might also have reduced the pragmatic ambiguity by making the two trailing
    sumti values explicit (the ``as perceived by'' and ``under conditions'' places have
    been added to the place structure of ``xunre''). But assume we have a really stubborn
    listener (an artificially semi-intelligent computer?) who will find a way to
    misinterpret <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> even with three specific sumti
    provided.</p>

    <p>In this case, we use a sumti tagged with the sumti tcita ``ci'u'', which
    translates roughly as ``on a scale of X'', where ``X'' is the sumti. For maximal
    clarity, the tagged sumti can be bound into the negated selbri with ``be''. To
    clarify <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a>, we might say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a non-(red on-a-scale-of-colorness)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>We can alternately use the sumti tcita ``teci'e'', based on ``ciste'', which
    translates roughly as ``of a system of components X'', for universes of discourse; in
    this case, we would express <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be teci'e le skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-with-components-the-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>Other places of ``ciste'' can be brought out using the grammar of selma'o BAI
    modals, allowing slightly different forms of expression, thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be ci'e lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-system-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``le'a'', also in selma'o BAI, can be used to specify a category:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  le stizu cu na'e xunre
        be le'a lo'i skari
    The chair is a non-(red
        of-a-category-which-is-the-set-of-colors)-thing.
</pre>which is minimally different in meaning from <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>.

    <p>The cmavo ``na'e'' is not the only member of selma'o NAhE. If we want to express a
    scalar negation which is a polar opposite, we use the cmavo ``to'e'', which is
    grammatically equivalent to ``na'e'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  le stizu cu to'e xunre
        be ci'u loka skari
    The chair is a (opposite-of red)
        on-scale a-property-of color-ness.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, the midpoint of a scale can be expressed with the cmavo ``no'e'', also
    grammatically equivalent to ``na'e''. Here are some parallel examples of ``na'e'',
    ``no'e'', and ``to'e'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  ta melbi
    That is-beautiful.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d10" name="e5d10">5.10)</a> ta na'e melbi
    That is-non-beautiful.
    That is other than beautiful.
    That is ugly [in one sense].

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d11" name="e5d11">5.11)</a> ta no'e melbi
    That is-neutrally beautiful.
    That is plain/ordinary-looking
        (neither ugly nor beautiful).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e5d12" name="e5d12">5.12)</a> ta to'e melbi
    That is-opposite-of beautiful.
    That is ugly/very ugly/repulsive.
</pre>

    <p>The cmavo ``to'e'' has the assigned rafsi ``-tol-'' and ``-to'e-''; the cmavo
    ``no'e'' has the assigned rafsi ``-nor-'' and ``-no'e-''. The selbri in <a href=
    "#e5d10">Example 5.10</a> through <a href="#e5d12">Example 5.12</a> could be replaced
    by the lujvo ``nalmle'', ``normle'', and ``tolmle'' respectively.</p>

    <p>This large variety of scalar negations is provided because different scales have
    different properties. Some scales are open-ended in both directions: there is no
    ``ultimately ugly'' or ``ultimately beautiful''. Other scales, like temperature, are
    open at one end and closed at the other: there is a minimum temperature (so-called
    ``absolute zero'') but no maximum temperature. Still other scales are closed at both
    ends.</p>

    <p>Correspondingly, some selbri have no obvious ``to'e'' --- what is the opposite of
    a dog? --- while others have more than one, and need ``ci'u'' to specify which
    opposite is meant.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s6" name="s6">6. sumti negation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s6" name="s6">There are two ways of negating sumti in Lojban. We have the
    choice of quantifying the sumti with zero, or of applying the sumti-negator
    ``na'ebo'' before the sumti. It turns out that a zero quantification serves for
    contradictory negation. As the cmavo we use implies, ``na'ebo'' forms a scalar
    negation.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s6" name="s6">Let us show examples of each.</a></p>

        of the French country are-hair-without.
    No current king of France is bald.
</pre>

    <p>Is <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a> true? Yes, because it merely claims that of the
    current Kings of France, however many there may be, none are bald, which is plainly
    true, since there are no such current Kings of France.</p>

    <p>Now let us look at the same sentence using ``na'ebo'' negation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  na'ebo lo ca nolraitru

    [Something] other-than-(the-current-noblest-governor

    Something other than the current King of France is bald.
</pre><a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> is true provided that something reasonably
describable as ``other than a current King of France'', such as the King of Saudi Arabia,
or a former King of France, is in fact bald.

    <p>In place of ``na'ebo'', you may also use ``no'ebo'' and ``to'ebo'', to be more
    specific about the sumti which would be appropriate in place of the stated sumti.
    Good examples are hard to come by, but here's a valiant try:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  mi klama to'ebo la bastn.
    I go to the-opposite-of Boston.
    I go to Perth.
</pre>(Boston and Perth are nearly, but not quite, antipodal cities. In a purely United
States context, San Francisco might be a better ``opposite''.) Coming up with good
examples is difficult, because attaching ``to'ebo'' to a description sumti is usually the
same as attaching ``to'e'' to the selbri of the description.

    <p>It is not possible to transform sumti negations of either type into bridi
    negations or scalar selbri negations. Negations of sumti will be used in Lojban
    conversation. The inability to manipulate these negations logically will, it is
    hoped, prevent the logical errors that result when natural languages attempt
    corresponding manipulations.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s7" name="s7">7. Negation of minor grammatical constructs</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s7" name="s7">We have a few other constructs that can be negated, all of
    them based on negating individual words. For such negation, we use the
    suffix-combining negator, which is ``nai''. ``nai'', by the way, is almost always
    written as a compound into the previous word that it is negating, although it is a
    regular separate-word cmavo and the sole member of selma'o NAI.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s7" name="s7">Most of these negation forms are straightforward, and should
    be discussed and interpreted in connection with an analysis of the particular
    construct being negated. Thus, we will not go into much detail here.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s7" name="s7">The following are places where ``nai'' is used:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s7" name="s7">When attached to tenses and modals (see</a> <a href=
    "chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>), the ``nai'' suffix usually indicates a
    contradictory negation of the tagged bridi. Thus ``punai'' as a tense inflection
    means ``not-in-the-past'', or ``not-previously'', without making any implication
    about any other time period unless explicitly stated. As a result,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi na pu klama le zarci
    I [false] [past] go-to the store.
    I didn't go to the store.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  mi punai klama le zarci
    I [past-not] go-to the store.
    I didn't go to the store.
</pre>mean exactly the same thing, although there may be a difference of emphasis.

    <p>Tenses and modals can be logically connected, with the logical connectives
    containing contradictory negations; this allows negated tenses and modals to be
    expressed positively using logical connectives. Thus ``punai je ca'' means the same
    thing as ``pu naje ca''.</p>

    <p>As a special case, a ``-nai'' attached to the interval modifiers of selma'o TAhE,
    ROI, or ZAhO (explained in <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>) signals a scalar
    negation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  mi paroinai dansu le bisli
    I [once] [not] dance-on the ice
</pre>means that I dance on the ice either zero or else two or more times within the
relevant time interval described by the bridi. <a href="#e7d3">Example 7.3</a> is very
different from the English use of ``not once'', which is an emphatic way of saying
``never'' --- that is, exactly zero times.

    <p>In indicators and attitudinals of selma'o UI or CAI, ``nai'' denotes a polar
    negation. As discussed in <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>, most indicators
    have an implicit scale, and ``nai'' changes the indicator to refer to the opposite
    end of the scale. Thus ``.uinai'' expresses unhappiness, and ``.ienai'' expresses
    disagreement (not ambivalence, which is expressed with the neutral or undecided
    intensity as ``.iecu'i'').</p>

    <p>Vocative cmavo of selma'o COI are considered a kind of indicator, but one which
    identifies the listener. Semantically, we could dispense with about half of the COI
    selma'o words based on the scalar paradigm. For example, ``co'o'' could be expressed
    as ``coinai''. However, this is not generally done.</p>

    <p>Most of the COI cmavo are used in what are commonly called protocol situations.
    These protocols are used, for example, in radio conversations, which often take place
    in a noisy environment. The negatives of protocol words tend to convey diametrically
    opposite communications situations (as might be expected). Therefore, only one
    protocol vocative is dependent on ``nai'': negative acknowledgement, which is
    ``je'enai'' (``I didn't get that'').</p>

    <p>Unlike the attitudinal indicators, which tend to be unimportant in noisy
    situations, the protocol vocatives become more important. So if, in a noisy
    environment, a protocol listener makes out only ``nai'', he or she can presume it is
    a negative acknowledgement and repeat transmission or otherwise respond accordingly.
    <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a> provides more detail on this topic.</p>

    <p>The abstractors of selma'o NU follow the pattern of the tenses and modals. NU
    allows negative abstractions, especially in compound abstractions connected by
    logical connectives: ``su'ujeninai'', which corresponds to ``su'u jenai ni'' just as
    ``punai je ca'' corresponds to ``pu naje ca''. It is not clear how much use logically
    connected abstractors will be: see <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

    <p>A ``nai'' attached to a non-logical connective (of selma'o JOI or BIhI) is a
    scalar negation, and says that the bridi is false under the specified mixture, but
    that another connective is applicable. Non-logical connectives are discussed in
    <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>.</p>

    (those which expect the answers ``Yes'' or ``No''). The truth question cmavo ``xu''

    as a whole is true or false.</a></p>

</pre>

    <p>You can now use each of the several kinds of negation we've discussed in answer to
    this (presuming the same question and context for each answer).</p>

    <p>The straightforward negative answer is grammatically equivalent to the expanded
    sentence with the ``na'' immediately after the ``cu'' (and before any
    tense/modal):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  na go'i

    John [false] previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.
    It's not true that John went to Paris and Rome.

    <p>The respondent can change the tense, putting the ``na'' in either before or after
    the new tense:</p>

    John [false] later-will-go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
    It is false that John will go to Paris and Rome.
</pre>or alternatively
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  ba na go'i

    John later-will [false] go-to [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>We stated in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a> that sentences like <a href=
    "#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> and <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> appear to be semantically
    identical, but that subtle semantic distinctions may eventually be found.</p>

    <p>You can also use a scalar negation with ``na'e'', in which case, it is equivalent
    to putting a ``na'eke'' immediately after any tense:</p>
    <pre>

    <p>He might have telephoned the two cities instead of going there. The unnecessary

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s9" name="s9">9. Affirmations</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s9" name="s9">There is an explicit positive form for both selma'o NA
    (``ja'a'') and selma'o NAhE (``je'a''), each of which would supplant the
    corresponding negator in the grammatical position used, allowing one to assert the
    positive in response to a negative question or statement without confusion. Assuming
    the same context as in</a> <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  xu na go'i

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  xu la djan. [cu] na pu klama
        la paris. .e la rom.
    Is it true that: John [false] previously-went-to
        [both] Paris and Rome.]
</pre>

    <p>The obvious, but incorrect, positive response to this negative question is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  go'i
    [repeat previous]
</pre>

    <p>A plain ``go'i'' does not mean ``Yes it is''; it merely abbreviates repeating the
    previous statement unmodified, including any negators present; and <a href=
    "#e9d3">Example 9.3</a> actually states that it is false that John went to both Paris
    and Rome.</p>

    <p>When considering:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  na go'i
    [false] [repeat previous]
</pre>as a response to a negative question like <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a>, Lojban
designers had to choose between two equally plausible interpretations with opposite
effects. Does <a href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a> create a double negative in the sentence by
adding a new ``na'' to the one already there (forming a double negative and hence a
positive statement), or does the ``na'' replace the previous one, leaving the sentence
unchanged?

    <p>It was decided that substitution, the latter alternative, is the preferable
    choice, since it is then clear whether we intend a positive or a negativ sentence
    without performing any manipulations. This is the way English usually works, but not
    all languages work this way --- Russian, Japanese, and Navajo all interpret a
    negative reply to a negative question as positive.</p>

    <p>The positive assertion cmavo of selma'o NA can also replace the ``na'' in the
    context, giving:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  ja'a go'i
    (John truly-(previously went-to) [both] Paris and Rome.)
</pre>``ja'a'' can replace ``na'' in a similar manner wherever the latter is used:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  ja'a go'i
    John indeed previously went-to [both] Paris and Rome.
</pre>``je'a'' can replace ``na'e'' in exactly the same way, stating that scalar negation
does not apply, and that the relation indeed holds as stated. In the absence of a
negation context, it emphasizes the positive:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  ta je'a melbi
    that is-indeed beautiful.
</pre>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s10" name="s10">10. Metalinguistic negation forms</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-s10" name="s10">The question of truth or falsity is not entirely synonymous
    with negation. Consider the English sentence</a></p>

"e10d1">10.1)</a>    I have not stopped beating my wife.
</pre>

    <p>If I never started such a heinous activity, then this sentence is neither true nor
    false. Such a negation simply says that something is wrong with the non-negated
    statement. Generally, we then use either tone of voice or else a correction to
    express a preferred true claim: ``I never have beaten my wife.''</p>

    <p>Negations which follow such a pattern are called ``metalinguistic negations''. In
    natural languages, the mark of metalinguistic negation is that an indication of a
    correct statement always, or almost always, follows the negation. Tone of voice or
    emphasis may be further used to clarify the error.</p>

    <p>Negations of every sort must be expressible in Lojban; errors are inherent to
    human thought, and are not excluded from the language. When such negations are
    metalinguistic, we must separate them from logical claims about the truth or falsity
    of the statement, as well as from scalar negations which may not easily express (or
    imply) the preferred claim. Because Lojban allows concepts to be so freely combined
    in tanru, limits on what is plausible or not plausible tend to be harder to
    determine.</p>

    <p>Mimicking the muddled nature of natural language negation would destroy this
    separation. Since Lojban does not use tone of voice, we need other means to
    metalinguistically indicate what is wrong with a statement. When the statement is
    entirely inappropriate, we need to be able to express metalinguistic negation in a
    more non-specific fashion.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of some different kinds of metalinguistic negation with
    English-language examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    I have not <i>stopped</i> beating my wife
    (I never started --- failure of presupposition).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a> 5 is not blue
    (color does not apply to abstract concepts --
    failure of category).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a> The current King of France is not bald.
    (there is no current King of France ---
    existential failure)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a> I do not have THREE children.
    (I have two --- simple undue quantity)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a> I have not held THREE jobs previously, but four.
    (inaccurate quantity; the difference from the previous
    example is that someone who has held four jobs has also
    held three jobs)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a> It is not good, but bad.
    (undue quantity negation indicating that the value on a
    scale for measuring the predicate is incorrect)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a> She is not PRETTY; she is beautiful
    (undue quantity transferred to a non-numeric scale)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a> The house is not blue, but green.
    (the scale/category being used is incorrect, but a
    related category applies)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d10" name="e10d10">10.10)</a>   The house is not blue, but is colored.
    (the scale/category being used is incorrect, but a
    broader category applies)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d11" name="e10d11">10.11)</a>   The cat is not blue, but long-haired.
    (the scale/category being used is incorrect, but an
    unrelated category applies)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d12" name="e10d12">10.12)</a>   A: He ain't coming today.
    B: ``Ain't'' ain't a word.
    (solecism, or improper grammatical action)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d13" name=
"e10d13">10.13)</a>   I haven't STOOPED beating my wife; I've STOPPED.
    (spelling or mispronunciation error)

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d14" name="e10d14">10.14)</a>   Not only was it a sheep, it was a black sheep.
    (non-contradictory correction)
</pre>

    <p>The set of possible metalinguistic errors is open-ended.</p>

    <p>Many of these forms have a counterpart in the various examples that we've
    discussed under logical negation. Metalinguistic negation doesn't claim that the
    sentence is false or true, though. Rather, it claims that, due to some error in the
    statement, ``true'' and ``false'' don't really apply.</p>

    <p>Because one can metalinguistically negate a true statement intending a
    non-contradictory correction (say, a spelling error); we need a way (or ways) to
    metalinguistically negate a statement which is independent of our logical negation
    schemes using ``na'', ``na'e'' and kin. The cmavo ``na'i'' is assigned this function.
    If it is present in a statement, it indicates metalinguistically that something in
    the statement is incorrect. This metalinguistic negation must override any evaluation
    of the logic of the statement. It is equally allowed in both positive and negative
    statements.</p>

    <p>Since ``na'i'' is not a logical operator, multiple occurrences of ``na'i'' need
    not be assumed to cancel each other. Indeed, we can use the position of ``na'i'' to
    indicate metalinguistically what is incorrect, preparatory to correcting it in a
    later sentence; for this reason, we give ``na'i'' the grammar of UI. The inclusion of
    ``na'i'' anywhere in a sentence makes it a non-assertion, and suggests one or more
    pitfalls in assigning a truth value.</p>

    <p>Let us briefly indicate how the above-mentioned metalinguistic errors can be
    identified. Other metalinguistic problems can then be marked by devising analogies to
    these examples:</p>

    <p>Existential failure can be marked by attaching ``na'i'' to the descriptor ``lo''
    or the ``poi'' in a ``da poi''-form sumti. (See Chapter 6 and <a href=
    "chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a> for details on these constructions.) Remember that if
    a ``le'' sumti seems to refer to a non-existent referent, you may not understand what
    the speaker has in mind --- the appropriate response is then ``ki'a'', asking for
    clarification.</p>

    <p>Presupposition failure can be marked directly if the presupposition is overt; if
    not, one can insert a ``mock presupposition'' to question with the sumti tcita
    (selma'o BAI) word ``ji'u''; ``ji'uku'' thus explicitly refers to an unexpressed
    assumption, and ``ji'una'iku'' metalinguistically says that something is wrong with
    that assumption. (See <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>.)</p>

    <p>Scale errors and category errors can be similarly expressed with selma'o BAI.
    ``le'a'' has meaning ``of category/class/type X'', ``ci'u'' has meaning ``on scale
    X'', and ``ci'e'', based on ``ciste'', can be used to talk about universes of
    discourse defined either as systems or sets of components, as shown in <a href=
    "#s8">Section 8</a>. ``kai'' and ``la'u'' also exist in BAI for discussing other
    quality and quantity errors.</p>

    <p>We have to make particular note of potential problems in the areas of undue
    quantity and incorrect scale/category. Assertions about the relationships between
    gismu are among the basic substance of the language. It is thus invalid to logically
    require that if something is blue, that it is colored, or if it is not-blue, then it
    is some other color. In Lojban, ``blanu'' (``blue'') is not explicitly defined as a
    ``skari'' (``color''). Similarly, it is not implicit that the opposite of ``good'' is
    ``bad''.</p>

    <p>This mutual independence of gismu is only an ideal. Pragmatically, people will
    categorize things based on their world-views. We will write dictionary definitions
    that will relate gismu, unfortunately including some of these world-view assumptions.
    Lojbanists should try to minimize these assumptions, but this seems a likely area
    where logical rules will break down (or where Sapir-Whorf effects will be made
    evident). In terms of negation, however, it is vital that we clearly preserve the
    capability of denying a presumably obvious scale or category assumption.</p>

    <p>Solecisms, grammatical and spelling errors will be marked by marking the offending
    word or phrase with ``na'i'' (in the manner of any selma'o UI cmavo). In this sense,
    ``na'i'' becomes equivalent to the English metalinguistic marker ``[sic]''. Purists
    may choose to use ZOI or LOhU/LEhU quotes or ``sa'a''-marked corrections to avoid
    repeating a truly unparsable passage, especially if a computer is to analyze the
    speech/text. See <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a> for explanations of these
    usages.</p>

    <p>In summary, metalinguistic negation will typically take the form of referring to a
    previous statement and marking it with one or more ``na'i'' to indicate what
    metalinguistic errors have been made, and then repeating the statement with
    corrections. References to previous statements may be full repetitions, or may use
    members of selma'o GOhA. ``na'i'' at the beginning of a statement merely says that
    something is inappropriate about the statement, without specificity.</p>

    <p>In normal use, metalinguistic negation requires that a corrected statement follow
    the negated statement. In Lojban, however, it is possible to completely and
    unambiguously specify metalinguistic errors without correcting them. It will
    eventually be seen whether an uncorrected metalinguistic negation remains an
    acceptable form in Lojban. In such a statement, metalinguistic expression would
    involve an ellipsis not unlike that of tenseless expression.</p>

    <p>Note that metalinguistic negation gives us another kind of legitimate negative
    answer to a ``xu'' question (see <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>). ``na'i'' will be used
    when something about the questioned statement is inappropriate, such as in questions
    like ``Have you stopped beating your wife?'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d15" name="e10d15">10.15)</a>  xu do sisti lezu'o do rapydarxi
        ledo fetspe
    Have you ceased the activity of repeat-hitting
        your female-spouse?
</pre>

    <p>Responses could include:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d16" name="e10d16">10.16)</a>  na'i go'i
    The bridi as a whole is inappropriate in some way.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d17" name="e10d17">10.17)</a>   go'i na'i
    The selbri (sisti) is inappropriate in some way.
</pre>

    <p>One can also specifically qualify the metalinguistic negation, by explicitly
    repeating the erroneous portion of the bridi to be metalinguistically negated, or
    adding on of the selma'o BAI qualifiers mentioned above:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-15-e10d18" name="e10d18">10.18)</a>  go'i ji'una'iku
    Some presupposition is wrong with the previous bridi.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, one may metalinguistically affirm a bridi with ``jo'a'', another cmavo of
    selma'o UI. A common use for ``jo'a'' might be to affirm that a particular
    construction, though unusual or counterintuitive, is in fact correct; another usage
    would be to disagree with --- by overriding --- a respondent's metalinguistic
    negation.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s1" name="s1">1. What's wrong with this picture?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s1" name="s1">The following brief dialogue is from</a> <a href=
    "chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a> of <cite>Through The Looking Glass</cite> by Lewis
    Carroll.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  ``Who did you pass on the road?'' the King went on,
    holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more
    hay.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d2" name="e1d2">1.2)</a>   ``Nobody,'' said the Messenger.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d3" name=
"e1d3">1.3)</a>   ``Quite right,'' said the King:  ``this young lady saw
    him too.  So of course Nobody walks slower than you.''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d4" name="e1d4">1.4)</a>   ``I do my best,'' the Messenger said in a sulky tone.
    ``I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do!''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d5" name="e1d5">1.5)</a>   ``He can't do that,'' said the King, ``or else
    he'd have been here first.''
</pre>

    <p>This nonsensical conversation results because the King insists on treating the
    word ``nobody'' as a name, a name of somebody. However, the essential nature of the
    English word ``nobody'' is that it doesn't refer to somebody; or to put the matter
    another way, there isn't anybody to which it refers.</p>

    <p>The central point of contradiction in the dialogue arises in <a href=
    "#e1d3">Example 1.3</a>, when the King says ``... Nobody walks slower than you''.
    This claim would be plausible if ``Nobody'' were really a name, since the Messenger
    could only pass someone who does walk more slowly than he. But the Messenger
    interprets the word ``nobody'' in the ordinary English way, and says (in <a href=
    "#e1d4">Example 1.4</a>) ``... nobody walks much faster than I do'' (i.e., I walk
    faster, or as fast as, almost everyone), which the King then again misunderstands.
    Both the King and the Messenger are correct according to their respective
    understandings of the ambiguous word ``nobody/Nobody''.</p>

    <p>There are Lojban words or phrases corresponding to the problematic English words
    ``somebody'', ``nobody'', ``anybody'', ``everybody'' (and their counterparts
    ``some/no/any/everyone'' and ``some/no/any/everything''), but they obey rules which
    can often be surprising to English-speakers. The dialogue above simply cannot be
    translated into Lojban without distortion: the name ``Nobody'' would have to be
    represented by a Lojban name, which would spoil the perfection of the wordplay. As a
    matter of fact, this is the desired result: a logical language should not allow two
    conversationalists to affirm ``Nobody walks slower than the Messenger'' and ``Nobody
    walks faster than the Messenger'' and both be telling the truth. (Unless, of course,
    nobody but the Messenger walks at all, or everyone walks at exactly the same
    speed.)</p>

    <p>This chapter will explore the Lojban mechanisms that allow the correct and
    consistent construction of sentences like those in the dialogue. There are no new
    grammatical constructs explained in this chapter; instead, it discusses the way in
    which existing facilities that allow Lojban-speakers to resolve problems like the
    above, using the concepts of modern logic. However, we will not approach the matter
    from the viewpoint of logicians, although readers who know something of logic will
    discover familiar notions in Lojban guise.</p>

    <p>Although Lojban is called a logical language, not every feature of it is
    ``logical''. In particular, the use of ``le'' is incompatible with logical reasoning
    based on the description selbri, because that selbri may not truthfully apply: you
    cannot conclude from my statement that</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e1d6" name="e1d6">1.6)</a>  mi viska le nanmu
    I see the-one-I-refer-to-as-the man.
    I see the man/men.
</pre>that there really is a man; the only thing you can conclude is that there is one
thing (or more) that I choose to refer to as a man. You cannot even tell which man is
meant for sure without asking me (although communication is served if you already know
from the context).

    <p>In addition, the use of attitudinals (see <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>)
    often reduces or removes the ability to make deductions about the bridi to which
    those attitudinals are applied. From the fact that I hope George will win the
    election, you can conclude nothing about George's actual victory or defeat.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s2" name="s2">2. Existential claims, prenexes, and variables</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s2" name="s2">Let us consider, to begin with, a sentence that is not in the
    dialogue:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s2" name="s2"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s2" name="s2"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  Something sees me.
</pre>

    <p>There are two plausible Lojban translations of <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>.
    The simpler one is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>  [zo'e] viska mi
    Something-unspecified sees me.
</pre>The cmavo ``zo'e'' indicates that a sumti has been omitted (indeed, even ``zo'e''
itself can be omitted in this case, as explained in <a href="chapter7.html">Chapter
7</a>) and the listener must fill in the correct value from context. In other words,
<a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a> means ```You-know-what' sees me.''

    <p>However, <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a> is just as likely to assert simply that
    there is someone who sees me, in which case a correct translation is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  da zo'u da viska mi
    There-is-an-X such-that X sees me.
</pre><a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> does not presuppose that the listener knows who
sees the speaker, but simply tells the listener that there is someone who sees the
speaker. Statements of this kind are called ``existential claims''. (Formally, the one
doing the seeing is not restricted to being a person; it could be an animal or --- in
principle --- an inanimate object. We will see in <a href="#s4">Section 4</a> how to
represent such restrictions.)

    <p><a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> has a two-part structure: there is the part ``da
    zo'u'', called the prenex, and the part ``da viska mi'', the main bridi. Almost any
    Lojban bridi can be preceded by a prenex, which syntactically is any number of sumti
    followed by the cmavo ``zo'u'' (of selma'o ZOhU). For the moment, the sumti will
    consist of one or more of the cmavo ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' (of selma'o KOhA),
    glossed in the literal translations as ``X'', ``Y'', and ``Z'' respectively. By
    analogy to the terminology of symbolic logic, these cmavo are called
    ``variables''.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a prenex with two variables:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  da de zo'u da prami de
    There-is-an-X there-is-a-Y such that X loves Y.
    Somebody loves somebody.
</pre>In <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a>, the literal interpretation of the two variables
``da'' and ``de'' as ``there-is-an-X'' and ``there-is-a-Y'' tells us that there are two
things which stand in the relationship that one loves the other. It might be the case
that the supposed two things are really just a single thing that loves itself; nothing in
the Lojban version of <a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> rules out that interpretation,
which is why the colloquial translation does not say ``Somebody loves somebody else.''
The things referred to by different variables may be different or the same. (We use
``somebody'' here rather than ``something'' for naturalness; lovers and beloveds are
usually persons, though the Lojban does not say so.)

    <p>It is perfectly all right for the variables to appear more than once in the main
    bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d5" name="e2d5">2.5)</a>  da zo'u da prami da
    There-is-an-X such that X loves X
    Somebody loves himself/herself.
</pre>What <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a> claims is fundamentally different from what
<a href="#e2d4">Example 2.4</a> claims, because ``da prami da'' is not structurally the
same as ``da prami de''. However,
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d6" name="e2d6">2.6)</a>  de zo'u de prami de
    There-is-a-Y such that Y loves Y
</pre>means exactly the same thing as <a href="#e2d5">Example 2.5</a>; it does not matter
which variable is used as long as they are used consistently.

    <p>It is not necessary for a variable to be a sumti of the main bridi directly:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d7" name="e2d7">2.7)</a>  da zo'u le da gerku cu viska mi
    There-is-an-X such-that the of-X dog sees me
    Somebody's dog sees me
</pre>is perfectly correct even though the ``da'' is used only in a possessive
construction. (Possessives are explained in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>.)

    <p>It is very peculiar, however, even if technically grammatical, for the variable
    not to appear in the main bridi at all:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e2d8" name="e2d8">2.8)</a>  da zo'u la ralf. gerku
    There is something such that Ralph is a dog.
</pre>has a variable bound in a prenex whose relevance to the claim of the following
bridi is completely unspecified.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s3" name="s3">3. Universal claims</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s3" name="s3">What happens if we substitute ``everything'' for
    ``something'' in</a> <a href="#e2d1">Example 2.1</a>? We get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  Everything sees me.
</pre>Of course, this example is false, because there are many things which do not see
the speaker. It is not easy to find simple truthful examples of so-called universal
claims (those which are about everything), so bear with us for a while. (Indeed, some
Lojbanists tend to avoid universal claims even in other languages, since they are so
rarely true in Lojban.)

    <p>The Lojban translation of <a href="#e3d1">Example 3.1</a> is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  ro da zo'u da viska mi
    For-every X : X sees me.
</pre>When the variable cmavo ``da'' is preceded by ``ro'', the combination means ``For
every X'' rather than ``There is an X''. Superficially, these English formulations look
totally unrelated: <a href="#s6">Section 6</a> will bring them within a common viewpoint.
For the moment, accept the use of ``ro da'' for ``everything'' on faith.

    <p>Here is a universal claim with two variables:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  ro da ro de zo'u da prami de
    For-every X, for-every Y : X loves Y.
    Everything loves everything.
</pre>

    <p>Again, X and Y can represent the same thing, so <a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a>
    does not mean ``Everything loves everything else.'' Furthermore, because the claim is
    universal, it is about every thing, not merely every person, so we cannot use
    ``everyone'' or ``everybody'' in the translation.</p>

    <p>Note that ``ro'' appears before both ``da'' and ``de''. If ``ro'' is omitted
    before either variable, we get a mixed claim, partly existential like those of
    <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>, partly universal.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  ro da de zo'u da viska de
    For-every X, there-is-a-Y : X sees Y.
    Everything sees something.
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  da ro de zo'u da viska de
    There-is-an-X such-that-for-every-Y : X sees Y.
    Something sees everything.
</pre><a href="#e3d4">Examples 3.4</a> and <a href="#e3d5">3.5</a> mean completely
different things. <a href="#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> says that for everything, there is
something which it sees, not necessarily the same thing seen for every seer. <a href=
"#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>, on the other hand, says that there is a particular thing which
can see everything that there is (including itself). Both of these are fairly silly, but
they are different kinds of silliness.

    <p>There are various possible translations of universal claims in English: sometimes
    we use ``anybody/anything'' rather than ``everybody/everything''. Often it makes no
    difference which of these is used: when it does make a difference, it is a rather
    subtle one which is explained in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s4" name="s4">4. Restricted claims: ``da poi''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s4" name="s4">The universal claims of</a> <a href="#s3">Section 3</a> are
    not only false but absurd: there is really very little to be said that is both true
    and non-trivial about every object whatsoever. Furthermore, we have been glossing
    over the distinction between ``everything'' and ``everybody'' and the other pairs
    ending in ``-thing'' and ``-body''. It is time to bring up the most useful feature of
    Lojban variables: the ability to restrict their ranges.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, a variable ``da'', ``de'', or ``di'' may be followed by a ``poi''
    relative clause in order to restrict the range of things that the variable describes.
    Relative clauses are described in detail in <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>,
    but the kind we will need at present consist of ``poi'' followed by a bridi (often
    just a selbri) terminated with ``ku'o'' or ``vau'' (which can usually be elided).
    Consider the difference between</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  da zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X : X sees Jim.
    Something sees Jim.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e4d2" name="e4d2">4.2)</a>  da poi prenu zo'u da viska la djim.
    There-is-an-X which is-a-person : X sees Jim.
    Someone sees Jim.
</pre>In <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a>, the variable ``da'' can refer to any object
whatever; there are no restrictions on it. In <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>, ``da'' is
restricted by the ``poi prenu'' relative clause to persons only, and so ``da poi prenu''
translates as ``someone.'' (The difference between ``someone'' and ``somebody'' is a
matter of English style, with no real counterpart in Lojban.) If <a href="#e4d2">Example
4.2</a> is true, then <a href="#e4d1">Example 4.1</a> must be true, but not necessarily
vice versa.

    <p>Universal claims benefit even more from the existence of relative clauses.
    Consider</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  ro da zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X : X breathes
    Everything breathes
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  ro da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    For-every X which is-a-dog : X breathes.
    Every dog breathes.
    Each dog breathes.
    All dogs breathe.
</pre><a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> is a silly falsehood, but <a href="#e4d4">Example
4.4</a> is an important truth (at least if applied in a timeless or potential sense: see
<a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>). Note the various colloquial translations
``every dog'', ``each dog'', and ``all dogs''. They all come to the same thing in Lojban,
since what is true of every dog is true of all dogs. ``All dogs'' is treated as an
English plural and the others as singular, but Lojban makes no distinction.

    <p>If we make an existential claim about dogs rather than a universal one, we
    get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  da poi gerku zo'u da vasxu
    There-is-an-X which is-a-dog : X breathes.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s5" name="s5">5. Dropping the prenex</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s5" name="s5">It isn't really necessary for every Lojban bridi involving
    variables to have a prenex on the front. In fact, none of the examples we've seen so
    far required prenexes at all! The rule for dropping the prenex is simple: if the
    variables appear in the same order within the bridi as they did in the prenex, then
    the prenex is superfluous. However, any ``ro'' or ``poi'' appearing in the prenex
    must be transferred to the first occurrence of the variable in the main part of the
    bridi. Thus,</a> <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> becomes just:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  da viska mi
    There-is-an-X-which sees me.
    Something sees me.
</pre>and <a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> becomes:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  ro da poi gerku cu vasxu
    For-every X which is-a-dog, it-breathes.
    Every dog breathes.
</pre>You might well suppose, then, that the purpose of the prenex is to allow the
variables in it to appear in a different order than the bridi order, and that would be
correct. Consider
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  ro da poi prenu ku'o
        de poi gerku ku'o zo'u
            de batci da
    For-every X which is-a-person,
        there-is-a-Y which is-a-dog:
            Y bites X.
</pre>

    <p>The prenex of <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> is like that of <a href=
    "#e3d4">Example 3.4</a> (but with relative clauses): it notes that the following
    bridi is true of every person with respect to some dog, not necessarily the same dog
    for each. But in the main bridi part, the ``de'' appears before the ``da''.
    Therefore, the true translation is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  Every person is bitten by some dog (or other).
</pre>

    <p>If we tried to omit the prenex and move the ``ro'' and the relative clauses into
    the main bridi, we would get:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  de poi gerku cu batci
        ro da poi prenu
    There-is-a-Y which is-a-dog which-bites
        every Y which is-a-person
    Some dog bites everyone.
</pre>which has the structure of <a href="#e3d5">Example 3.5</a>: it says that there is a
dog (call him Fido) who bites, has bitten, or will bite every person that has ever
existed! We can safely rule out Fido's existence, and say that <a href="#e5d5">Example
5.5</a> is false, while agreeing to <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a>.

    <p>Even so, <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> is most probably false, since some people
    never experience dogbite. Examples like 5.3 and 4.4 (might there be some dogs which
    never have breathed, because they died as embryos?) indicate the danger in Lojban of
    universal claims even when restricted. In English we are prone to say that ``Everyone
    says'' or that ``Everybody does'' or that ``Everything is'' when in fact there are
    obvious counterexamples which we are ignoring for the sake of making a rhetorical
    point. Such statements are plain falsehoods in Lojban, unless saved by a context
    (such as tense) which implicitly restricts them.</p>

    <p>How can we express <a href="#e5d3">Example 5.3</a> in Lojban without a prenex?
    Since it is the order in which variables appear that matters, we can say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ro da poi prenu cu se batci
        de poi gerku
    Every-X which is-a-person is-bitten-by some-Y
        which is-a-dog.
</pre>using the conversion operator ``se'' (explained in <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter
5</a>) to change the selbri ``batci'' (``bites'') into ``se batci'' (``is bitten by'').
The translation given in <a href="#e5d4">Example 5.4</a> uses the corresponding strategy
in English, since English does not have prenexes (except in strained ``logician's
English''). This implies that a sentence with both a universal and an existential
variable can't be freely converted with ``se''; one must be careful to preserve the order
of the variables.

    <p>If a variable occurs more than once, then any ``ro'' or ``poi'' decorations are
    moved only to the first occurrence of the variable when the prenex is dropped. For
    example,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  di poi prenu zo'u
        ti xarci di di
    There-is-a-Z which is-a-person :
        this-thing is-a-weapon for-use-against-Z by-Z
    This is a weapon for someone to use against
        himself/herself.
</pre>(in which ``di'' is used rather than ``da'' just for variety) loses its prenex as
follows:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  ti xarci di
        poi prenu ku'o di
    This-thing is-a-weapon-for-use-against
        some-Z which is-a-person by-Z.
</pre>As the examples in this section show, dropping the prenex makes for terseness of
expression often even greater than that of English (Lojban is meant to be an unambiguous
language, not necessarily a terse or verbose one), provided the rules are observed.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s6" name="s6">6. Variables with generalized quantifiers</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s6" name="s6">So far, we have seen variables with either nothing in front,
    or with the cmavo ``ro'' in front. Now ``ro'' is a Lojban number, and means ``all'';
    thus ``ro prenu'' means ``all persons'', just as ``re prenu'' means ``two persons''.
    In fact, unadorned ``da'' is also taken to have an implicit number in front of it,
    namely ``su'o'', which means ``at least one''. Why is this? Consider</a> <a href=
    "#e2d3">Example 2.3</a> again, this time with an explicit ``su'o'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  su'o da zo'u da viska mi
    For-at-least-one X : X sees me.
    Something sees me.
</pre>

    <p>From this version of <a href="#e2d3">Example 2.3</a>, we understand the speaker's
    claim to be that of all the things that there are, at least one of them sees him or
    her. The corresponding universal claim, <a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>, says that of
    all the things that exist, every one of them can see the speaker.</p>

    <p>Any other number can be used instead of ``ro'' or ``su'o'' to precede a variable.
    Then we get claims like:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  re da zo'u da viska mi
    For-two-Xes : X sees me.
    Two things see me.
</pre>This means that exactly two things, no more or less, saw the speaker on the
relevant occasion. In English, we might take ``Two things see me'' to mean that at least
two things see the speaker, but there might be more; in Lojban, though, that claim would
have to be made as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  su'ore da zo'u da viska mi
    For-at-least-two Xes : X sees me.
</pre>which would be false if nothing, or only one thing, saw the speaker, but not
otherwise. We note the ``su'o'' here meaning ``at least''; ``su'o'' by itself is short
for ``su'opa'' where ``pa'' means ``one'', as is explained in <a href="chapter18.html">
    Chapter 18</a>.

    <p>The prenex may be removed from <a href="#e6d2">Examples 6.2</a> and <a href=
    "#e6d3">6.3</a> as from the others, leading to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  re da viska mi
    Two Xes see me.
</pre>and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  su'ore da viska mi
    At-least-two Xes see me.
</pre>respectively, subject to the rules prescribed in <a href="#s5">Section 5</a>.

    <p>Now we can explain the constructions ``ro prenu'' for ``all persons'' and ``re
    prenu'' for ``two persons'' which were casually mentioned at the beginning of this
    Section. In fact, ``ro prenu'', a so-called ``indefinite description'', is shorthand
    for ``ro DA poi prenu'', where ``DA'' represents a fictitious variable that hasn't
    been used yet and will not be used in future. (Even if all three of ``da'', ``de'',
    and ``di'' have been used up, it does not matter, for there are ways of getting more
    variables, discussed in <a href="#s14">Section 14</a>.) So in fact</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>  re prenu viska mi
    Two persons see me.
</pre>is short for

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  re da poi prenu cu viska mi

</pre>Note that when we move more than one variable to the prenex (along with its
attached relative clause), we must make sure that the variables are in the same order in
the prenex as in the bridi proper.

bite the same two men, or is it possible that there are two different men per dog, for
six men altogether? If the former interpretation is taken, the number of men involved is
fixed at two; but if the latter, then the speaker has to be taken as saying that there
might be any number of men between two and six inclusive. Let us transform <a href=
"#e7d1">Example 7.1</a> step by step as we did with <a href="#e6d6">Example 6.6</a>:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e7d2" name="e7d2">7.2)</a>  ci da poi gerku cu batci re de poi nanmu
    Three Xes which are-dogs bite two Ys which are-men.
</pre>(Note that we need separate variables ``da'' and ``de'', because of the rule that
says each indefinite description gets a variable never used before or since.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e7d3" name="e7d3">7.3)</a>  ci da poi gerku ku'o
        re de poi nanmu zo'u
            da batci de
    For-three Xes which are-dogs,
        for-two Ys which are-men :
            X bites Y.
</pre>

    <p>Here we see that indeed each of the dogs is said to bite two men, and it might be
    different men each time; a total of six biting events altogether.</p>

    <p>How then are we to express the other interpretation, in which just two men are
    involved? We cannot just reverse the order of variables in the prenex to</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e7d4" name="e7d4">7.4)</a>  re de poi nanmu ku'o
        ci da poi gerku zo'u da batci de
    For-two Ys which are-men,
        for-three Xes which are-dogs, X bites Y
</pre>for although we have now limited the number of men to exactly two, we end up with
an indeterminate number of dogs, from three to six. The distinction is called a ``scope
distinction'': in <a href="#e7d2">Example 7.2</a>, ``ci gerku'' is said to have wider
scope than ``re nanmu'', and therefore precedes it in the prenex. In <a href=
"#e7d4">Example 7.4</a> the reverse is true.

    <p>The solution is to use a termset, which is a group of terms either joined by
    ``ce'e'' (of selma'o CEhE) between each term, or else surrounded by ``nu'i'' (of
    selma'o NUhI) on the front and ``nu'u'' (of selma'o NUhU) on the rear. Terms (which
    are either sumti or sumti prefixed by tense or modal tags) that are grouped into a
    termset are understood to have equal scope:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e7d5" name="e7d5">7.5)</a>  ci gerku ce'e re nanmu cu batci
    nu'i ci gerku re nanmu [nu'u] cu batci
    Three dogs [plus] two men, bite.
</pre>which picks out two groups, one of three dogs and the other of two men, and says
that every one of the dogs bites each of the men. The second Lojban version uses
forethought; note that ``nu'u'' is an elidable terminator, and in this case can be freely
elided.

    <p>What about descriptors, like ``ci lo gerku'', ``le nanmu'' or ``re le ci mlatu''?
    They too can be grouped in termsets, but usually need not be, except for the ``lo''
    case which functions like the case without a descriptor. Unless an actual quantifier
    precedes it, ``le nanmu'' means ``ro le nanmu'', as is explained in <a href=
    "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>. Two sumti with ``ro'' quantifiers are independent of
    order, so:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e7d6" name="e7d6">7.6)</a>  [ro] le ci gerku cu batci [ro] le re nanmu
    [All of] the three dogs bite [all of] the two men.
</pre>means that each of the dogs specified bites each of the men specified, for six acts
of biting altogether. However, if there is an explicit quantifier before ``le'' other
than ``ro'', the problems of this section reappear.

    <p>Using the facilities already discussed, a plausible translation might be</p>

    All X such-that-it goes-to the store walks-on the field.
    Everyone who goes to the store walks across the field.
</pre>But there is a subtle difference between <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a> and
<a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a>. <a href="#e8d2">Example 8.2</a> tells us that, in fact,
there are people who go to the store, and that they walk across the field. A sumti of the
type ``ro da poi klama'' requires that there are things which ``klama'': Lojban universal
claims always imply the corresponding existential claims as well. <a href="#e8d1">Example
8.1</a>, on the other hand, does not require that there are any people who go to the
store: it simply states, conditionally, that if there is anyone who goes to the store, he
or she walks across the field as well. This conditional form mirrors the true Lojban
translation of <a href="#e8d1">Example 8.1</a>:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>  ro da zo'u ganai da klama le zarci
        gi cadzu le foldi
    For-every X: if X is-a-goer-to the store
        then X is-a-walker-on the field.
</pre>Although <a href="#e8d3">Example 8.3</a> is a universal claim as well, its
universality only implies that there are objects of some sort or another in the universe
of discourse. Because the claim is conditional, nothing is implied about the existence of
goers-to-the-store or of walkers-on-the-field, merely that any entity which is one is
also the other.

    <p>There is another use of ``any'' in English that is not universal but existential.
    Consider</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>  I need any box that is bigger than this one.
</pre><a href="#e8d4">Example 8.4</a> does not at all mean that I need every box bigger
than this one, for indeed I do not; I require only one box. But the naive translation
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  mi nitcu da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti
    I need some-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this-one
</pre>does not work either, because it asserts that there really is such a box, as the
prenex paraphrase demonstrates:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti zo'u mi nitcu da
    There-is-an-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this : I need X.
</pre>

    <p>What to do? Well, the x2 place of ``nitcu'' can be filled with an event as well as
    an object, and in fact <a href="#e8d5">Example 8.5</a> can also be paraphrased
    as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d7" name="e8d7">8.7)</a>  mi nitcu lo nu mi ponse
        lo tanxe poi bramau ti
    I need an event-of I possess
        some box(es) which-are bigger-than this-one.
</pre>

    <p>Rewritten using variables, <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> becomes</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d8" name="e8d8">8.8)</a>  mi nitcu lo nu da zo'u

            gi'e bramau ti
    I need an event-of there-being an-X such-that
        X is-possessed-by me and is-a-box
            and is-bigger-than this-thing.
</pre>So we see that a prenex can be attached to a bridi that is within a sentence. By
default, a variable always behaves as if it is bound in the prenex which (notionally) is
attached to the smallest enclosing bridi, and its scope does not extend beyond that
bridi. However, the variable may be placed in an outer prenex explicitly:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d9" name="e8d9">8.9)</a>  da poi tanxe
        gi'e bramau ti zo'u
        mi nitcu le nu mi ponse da
    There-is-an-X which is-a-box
        and is-bigger-than this-one such-that
        I need the event-of my possessing X.
</pre>But what are the implications of <a href="#e8d7">Example 8.7</a> and <a href=
"#e8d9">Example 8.9</a>? The main difference is that in <a href="#e8d9">Example 8.9</a>,
the ``da'' is said to exist in the real world of the outer bridi; but in <a href="#e8d7">
    Example 8.7</a>, the existence is only within the inner bridi, which is a mere event
    that need not necessarily come to pass. So <a href="#e8d9">Example 8.9</a> means
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e8d10" name="e8d10">8.10)</a>    There's a box, bigger than this one, that I need
</pre>which is what <a href="#e8d6">Example 8.6</a> says, whereas <a href="#e8d7">Example
8.7</a> turns out to be an effective translation of our original <a href="#e8d1">Example
8.1</a>. So uses of ``any'' that aren't universal end up being reflected by variables
bound in the prenex of a subordinate bridi.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s9" name="s9">9. Negation boundaries</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s9" name="s9">This section, as well as</a> <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>
    through <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>, are in effect a continuation of <a href=
    "chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>, introducing features of Lojban negation that require
    an understanding of prenexes and variables. In the examples below, ``there is a Y''
    and the like must be understood as ``there is at least one Y, possibly more''.</p>

    <p>As explained in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>, the negation of a bridi
    is usually accomplished by inserting ``na'' at the beginning of the selbri:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi na klama le zarci
    I [false] go-to the store.
    It is false that I go to the store.
    I don't go to the store.
</pre>The other form of bridi negation is expressed by using the compound cmavo ``naku''
in the prenex, which is identified and compounded by the lexer before looking at the
sentence grammar. In Lojban grammar, ``naku'' is then treated like a sumti. In a prenex,
``naku'' means precisely the same thing as the logician's ``it is not the case that'' in
a similar English context. (Outside of a prenex, ``naku'' is also grammatically treated
as a single entity --- the equivalent of a sumti --- but does not have this exact
meaning; we'll discuss these other situations in <a href="#s11">Section 11</a>.)

    <p>To represent a bridi negation using a prenex, remove the ``na'' from before the
    selbri and place ``naku'' at the left end of the prenex. This form is called
    ``external bridi negation'', as opposed to ``internal bridi negation'' using ``na''.
    The prenex version of <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a> is</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  naku zo'u la djan. klama
    It is not the case that: John comes.
    It is false that: John comes.
</pre>However, ``naku'' can appear at other points in the prenex as well. Compare
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  naku de zo'u de zutse
    It is not the case that: for some Y, Y sits.
    It is false that: for at least one Y, Y sits.
    It is false that something sits.
    Nothing sits.
</pre>with
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  su'ode naku zo'u de zutse
    For at least one Y, it is false that: Y sits.
    There is something that doesn't sit.
</pre>

    <p>The relative position of negation and quantification terms within a prenex has a
    drastic effect on meaning. Starting without a negation, we can have:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  roda su'ode zo'u da prami de
    For every X, there is a Y, such that X loves Y.
    Everybody loves at least one thing (each,
        not necessarily the same thing).
</pre>or:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  su'ode roda zo'u da prami de
    There is a Y, such that for each X, X loves Y.
    There is at least one particular thing
        that is loved by everybody.
</pre>

    <p>The simplest form of bridi negation to interpret is one where the negation term is
    at the beginning of the prenex:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  naku roda su'ode zo'u
        da prami de
    It is false that: for every X, there is a Y, such that:
        X loves Y.
    It is false that: everybody loves at least one thing.
    (At least) someone doesn't love anything.
</pre>the negation of <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a>, and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d8" name="e9d8">9.8)</a>  naku su'ode roda zo'u
        da prami de
    It is false that: there is a Y such that for each X,
        X loves Y.
    It is false that: there is at least one thing that is
        loved by everybody.
    There isn't any one thing that everybody loves.
</pre>the negation of <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a>.

    <p>The rules of formal logic require that, to move a negation boundary within a
    prenex, you must ``invert any quantifier'' that the negation boundary passes across.
    Inverting a quantifier means that any ``ro'' (all) is changed to ``su'o'' (at least
    one) and vice versa. Thus, <a href="#e9d7">Example 9.7</a> and <a href=
    "#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> can be restated as, respectively:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d9" name="e9d9">9.9)</a>  su'oda naku su'ode zo'u
        da prami de
    For some X, it is false that: there is a Y such that:
        X loves Y.
    There is somebody who doesn't love anything.
</pre>and:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d10" name="e9d10">9.10)</a>    rode naku roda zo'u da prami de
    For every Y, it is false that: for every X, X loves Y.
    For each thing, it is not true that everybody loves it.
</pre>

    <p>Another movement of the negation boundary produces:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d11" name="e9d11">9.11)</a>    su'oda rode naku zo'u
        da prami de
    There is an X such that, for every Y,
        it is false that X loves Y.
    There is someone who, for each thing,
        doesn't love that thing.
and

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d12" name="e9d12">9.12)</a> rode su'oda naku zo'u da prami de
    For every Y, there is an X, such that it is false that:
        X loves Y.
    For each thing there is someone who doesn't love it.
</pre>Investigation will show that, indeed, each transformation preserves the meanings of
<a href="#e9d7">Example 9.7</a> and <a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a>.

    <p>The quantifier ``no'' (meaning ``zero of'') also involves a negation boundary. To
    transform a bridi containing a variable quantified with ``no'', we must first expand
    it. Consider</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d13" name="e9d13">9.13)</a>    noda rode zo'u da prami de
    There is no X, for every Y, such that X loves Y.
    Nobody loves everything.
</pre>which is negated by:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d14" name="e9d14">9.14)</a>    naku noda rode zo'u
        da prami de
    It is false that: there is no X that, for every Y,
        X loves Y.
    It is false that there is nobody who loves everything.
</pre>We can simplify <a href="#e9d14">Example 9.14</a> by transforming the prenex. To
move the negation phrase within the prenex, we must first expand the ``no'' quantifier.
Thus ``for no x'' means the same thing as ``it is false for some x'', and the
corresponding Lojban ``noda'' can be replaced by ``naku su'oda''. Making this
substitution, we get:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d15" name="e9d15">9.15)</a>    naku naku su'oda rode zo'u
        da prami de
    It is false that it is false that: for an X, for every Y:
        X loves Y.
</pre>

    <p>Adjacent double negation boundaries in the prenex can be dropped, so this means
    the same as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e9d16" name="e9d16">9.16)</a>    su'oda rode zo'u da prami de
    There is an X such that, for every Y, X loves Y.
    At least one person loves everything.
</pre>which is clearly the desired contradiction of <a href="#e9d13">Example 9.13</a>.

    <p>The interactions between quantifiers and negation mean that you cannot eliminate
    double negatives that are not adjacent. You must first move the negation phrases so
    that they are adjacent, inverting any quantifiers they cross, and then the double
    negative can be eliminated.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s10" name="s10">10. bridi negation and logical connectives</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s10" name="s10">A complete discussion of logical connectives appears in</a>
    <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. What is said here is intentionally quite
    incomplete and makes several oversimplifications.</p>

    <p>A logical connective is a cmavo or compound cmavo. In this chapter, we will make
    use of the logical connectives ``and'' and ``or'' (where ``or'' really means
    ``and/or'', ``either or both''). The following simplified recipes explain how to make
    some logical connectives:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with ``and'', put them both in the bridi
      and separate them with the cmavo ``.e''.</dd>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with ``and'', replace the regular
      separator cmavo ``.i'' with the compound cmavo ``.ije''.</dd>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban sumti with ``or'', put them both in the bridi
      and separate them with the cmavo ``.a''.</dd>

      <dd>To logically connect two Lojban bridi with ``or'', replace the regular
      separator cmavo ``.i'' with the compound cmavo ``.ija''.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>More complex logical connectives also exist; in particular, one may place ``na''
    before ``.e'' or ``.a'', or between ``.i'' and ``je'' or ``ja''; likewise, one may
    place ``nai'' at the end of a connective. Both ``na'' and ``nai'' have negative
    effects on the sumti or bridi being connected. Specifically, ``na'' negates the first
    or left-hand sumti or bridi, and ``nai'' negates the second or right-hand one.</p>

    <p>Whenever a logical connective occurs in a sentence, that sentence can be expanded
    into two sentences by repeating the common terms and joining the sentences by a
    logical connective beginning with ``.i''. Thus the following sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    mi .e do klama ti
    I and you come here.
</pre>can be expanded to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    mi klama ti  .ije do klama ti
    I come here, and, you come here.
</pre>

    <p>The same type of expansion can be performed for any logical connective, with any
    valid combination of ``na'' or ``nai'' attached. No change in meaning occurs under
    such a transformation.</p>

    <p>Clearly, if we know what negation means in the expanded sentence forms, then we
    know what it means in all of the other forms. But what does negation mean between
    sentences?</p>

    <p>The mystery is easily solved. A negation in a logical expression is identical to
    the corresponding bridi negation, with the negator placed at the beginning of the
    prenex. Thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    mi .enai do prami roda
    I, and not you, love everything.
</pre>expands to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    mi prami roda  .ijenai do prami roda
    I love everything, and-not, you love everything.
</pre>and then into prenex form as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    roda zo'u mi prami da
        .ije naku zo'u do prami da
    For each thing: I love it,
        and it is false that you love (the same) it.
</pre>By the rules of predicate logic, the ``ro'' quantifier on ``da'' has scope over
both sentences. That is, once you've picked a value for ``da'' for the first sentence, it
stays the same for both sentences. (The ``da'' continues with the same fixed value until
a new paragraph or a new prenex resets the meaning.)

    <p>Thus the following example has the indicated translation:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    su'oda zo'u mi prami da
        .ije naku zo'u do prami da
    For at least one thing: I love that thing.
        And it is false that: you love that (same) thing.
    There is something that I love that you don't.
</pre>If you remember only two rules for prenex manipulation of negations, you won't go
wrong:

    <dl>
      <dd>Within a prenex, whenever you move ``naku'' past a bound variable (da, de, di,
      etc.), you must invert the quantifier.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dd>A ``na'' before the selbri is always transformed into a ``naku'' at the
      left-hand end of the prenex, and vice versa.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>We cannot express this directly with ``na''; the apparently obvious

    It is false that some which are children
        go-to some which are schools.
    All children don't go to some school
        (not just some children).
</pre>Lojban provides a negation form which more closely emulates natural language
negation. This involves putting ``naku'' before the selbri, instead of a ``na''. ``naku''
is clearly a contradictory negation, given its parallel with prenex bridi negation. Using
``naku'', <a href="#e11d1">Example 11.1</a> can be expressed as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    su'oda poi verba naku klama
        su'ode poi ckule
    Some which-are children don't go-to
        some which-are schools.
    Some children don't go to a school.
</pre>Although it is not technically a sumti, ``naku'' can be used in most of the places
where a sumti may appear. We'll see what this means in a moment.

    <p>When you use ``naku'' within a bridi, you are explicitly creating a negation
    boundary. As explained in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>, when a prenex negation
    boundary expressed by ``naku'' moves past a quantifier, the quantifier has to be
    inverted. The same is true for ``naku'' in the bridi proper. We can move ``naku'' to
    any place in the sentence where a sumti can go, inverting any quantifiers that the
    negation boundary crosses. Thus, the following are equivalent to <a href=
    "#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> (no good English translations exist):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    su'oda poi verba cu klama rode poi ckule naku
    For some children, for every school,
        they don't go to it.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a> su'oda poi verba cu klama naku su'ode poi ckule
    Some children don't go to (some) school(s).

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a> naku roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
    It is false that all children go to some school(s).
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e11d5">Example 11.5</a>, we moved the negation boundary rightward
    across the quantifier of ``de'', forcing us to invert it. In <a href="#e11d7">Example
    11.7</a> we moved the negation boundary across the quantifier of ``da'', forcing us
    to invert it instead. <a href="#e11d6">Example 11.6</a> merely switched the selbri
    and the negation boundary, with no effect on the quantifiers.</p>

    <p>The same rules apply if you rearrange the sentence so that the quantifier crosses
    an otherwise fixed negation. You can't just convert the selbri of <a href=
    "#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> and rearrange the sumti to produce</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d8" name=
"e11d8">11.8)</a>    su'ode poi ckule ku'o naku se klama roda poi verba
    Some schools aren't gone-to-by every child.
</pre>or rather, <a href="#e11d8">Example 11.8</a> means something completely different
from <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a>. Conversion with ``se'' under ``naku'' negation is
not symmetric; not all sumti are treated identically, and some sumti are not invariant
under conversion. These complications would make Lojban much harder to learn (just as
their corresponding natural language constructs are difficult to learn). Thus, internal
negation with ``naku'' is considered an advanced technique, used to achieve stylistic
compatibility with natural languages.

    <p>It isn't always easy to see which quantifiers have to be inverted in a sentence.
    <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> is identical in meaning to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d9" name="e11d9">11.9)</a>    su'o verba naku klama su'o ckule
    Some children don't go-to some school.
</pre>but in <a href="#e11d9">Example 11.9</a>, the bound variables ``da'' and ``de''
have been hidden.

    <p>It is trivial to export an internal bridi negation expressed with ``na'' to the
    prenex, as we saw in <a href="#s9">Section 9</a>; you just move it to the left end of
    the prenex. In comparison, it is non-trivial to export a ``naku'' to the prenex
    because of the quantifiers. The rules for exporting ``naku'' require that you export
    all of the quantified variables (implicit or explicit) along with ``naku'', and you
    must export them from left to right, in the same order that they appear in the
    sentence. Thus <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a> goes into prenex form as:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d10" name="e11d10">11.10)</a>  su'oda poi verba ku'o naku
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            da klama de
    For some X which is a child, it is not the case that
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            X goes to Y.
</pre>

    <p>We can now move the ``naku'' to the left end of the prenex, getting a
    contradictory negation that can be expressed with ``na'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d11" name="e11d11">11.11)</a>  naku roda poi verba
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            da klama de
    It is not the case that for all X's which are children,
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            X goes to Y.
</pre>from which we can restore the quantified variables to the sentence, giving:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d12" name=
"e11d12">11.12)</a>  naku zo'u roda poi verba cu klama su'ode poi ckule
    It is not the case that all children go to some school.
</pre>or more briefly
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d13" name="e11d13">11.13)</a>  ro verba cu na klama su'o ckule
    All children [false] go-to some school(s).
</pre>As noted in <a href="#s5">Section 5</a>, a sentence with two different quantified
variables, such as <a href="#e11d13">Example 11.13</a>, cannot always be converted with
``se'' without first exporting the quantified variables. When the variables have been
exported, the sentence proper can be converted, but the quantifier order in the prenex
must remain unchanged:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d14" name="e11d14">11.14)</a>  roda poi verba
        su'ode poi ckule zo'u
            de na se klama da
    It is not the case that for all X's which are children,
        there is a Y which is a school such that:
            Y is gone to by X.
</pre>While you can't freely convert with ``se'' when you have two quantified variables
in a sentence, you can still freely move sumti to either side of the selbri, as long as
the order isn't changed. If you use ``na'' negation in such a sentence, nothing special
need be done. If you use ``naku'' negation, then quantified variables that cross the
negation boundary must be inverted.

    <p>Clearly, if all of Lojban negation was built on ``naku'' negation instead of
    ``na'' negation, logical manipulation in Lojban would be as difficult as in natural
    languages. In <a href="#s12">Section 12</a>, for example, we'll discuss DeMorgan's
    Law, which must be used whenever a sumti with a logical connection is moved across a
    negation boundary.</p>

    <p>Since ``naku'' has the grammar of a sumti, it can be placed almost anywhere a
    sumti can go, including ``be'' and ``bei'' clauses; it isn't clear what these mean,
    and we recommend avoiding such constructs.</p>

    <p>You can put multiple ``naku''s in a sentence, each forming a separate negation
    boundary. Two adjacent ``naku''s in a bridi are a double negative and cancel out:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e11d16" name="e11d16">11.16)</a>  mi naku naku le zarci cu klama
</pre>

    <p>Other expressions using two ``naku''s may or may not cancel out. If there is no
    quantified variable between them, then the ``naku''s cancel.</p>

    <p>Negation with internal ``naku'' is clumsy and non-intuitive for logical
    manipulations, but then, so are the natural language features it is emulating.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s12" name="s12">12. Logical Connectives and DeMorgan's Law</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s12" name="s12">DeMorgan's Law states that when a logical connective
    between terms falls within a negation, then expanding the negation requires a change
    in the connective. Thus (where ``p'' and ``q'' stand for terms or sentences) ``not (p
    or q)'' is identical to ``not p and not q'', and ``not (p and q)'' is identical to
    ``not p or not q''. The corresponding changes for the other two basic Lojban
    connectives are: ``not (p equivalent to q)'' is identical to ``not p exclusive-or not
    q'', and ``not (p whether-or-not q)'' is identical to both ``not p whether-or-not q''
    and ``not p whether-or-not not q''. In any Lojban sentence having one of the basic
    connectives, you can substitute in either direction from these identities. (These
    basic connectives are explained in</a> <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>.)</p>

    <p>The effects of DeMorgan's Law on the logical connectives made by modifying the
    basic connectives with ``nai'', ``na'' and ``se'' can be derived directly from these
    rules; modify the basic connective for DeMorgan's Law by substituting from the above
    identities, and then, apply each ``nai'', ``na'' and ``se'' modifier of the original
    connectives. Cancel any double negatives that result.</p>

    <p>When do we apply DeMorgan's Law? Whenever we wish to ``distribute'' a negation
    over a logical connective; and, for internal ``naku'' negation, whenever a logical
    connective moves in to, or out of, the scope of a negation --- when it crosses a
    negation boundary.</p>

    <p>Let us apply DeMorgan's Law to some sample sentences. These sentences make use of
    forethought logical connectives, which are explained in <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. It suffices to know that ``ga'' and ``gi'', used
    before each of a pair of sumti or bridi, mean ``either'' and ``or'' respectively, and
    that ``ge'' and ``gi'' used similarly mean ``both'' and ``and''. Furthermore, ``ga'',
    ``ge'', and ``gi'' can all be suffixed with ``nai'' to negate the bridi or sumti that
    follows.</p>

    <p>We have defined ``na'' and ``naku zo'u'' as, respectively, internal and external
    bridi negation. These forms being identical, the negation boundary always remains at
    the left end of the prenex. Thus, exporting or importing negation between external
    and internal bridi negation forms never requires DeMorgan's Law to be applied.
    <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> and <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a> are exactly
    equivalent:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d1" name="e12d1">12.1)</a>    la djan. na klama ga la paris. gi la rom.
    John [false] goes-to either Paris or Rome.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a> naku zo'u la djan. klama ga la paris. gi la rom.
    It-is-false that: John goes-to either Paris or Rome.
</pre>It is not an acceptable logical manipulation to move a negator from the bridi level
to one or more sumti. However, <a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> and related examples are
not sumti negations, but rather expand to form two logically connected sentences. In such
a situation, DeMorgan's Law must be applied. For instance, <a href="#e12d2">Example
12.2</a> expands to:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    ge la djan. la paris. na klama
        gi la djan. la rom. na klama
    [It is true that] both John, to-Paris, [false] goes,
        and John, to-Rome, [false] goes.
</pre>

    <p>The ``ga'' and ``gi'', meaning ``either-or'', have become ``ge'' and ``gi'',
    meaning ``both-and'', as a consequence of moving the negators into the individual
    bridi.</p>

    <p>Here is another example of DeMorgan's Law in action, involving bridi-tail logical
    connection (explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    la djein. le zarci na ge dzukla gi bajrykla
    Jane to-the market [false] both walks and runs.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a> la djein. le zarci ganai dzukla ginai bajrykla
    Jane to-the market either [false] walks or [false] runs.
    Jane to-the market if walks then ([false] runs).
</pre>(Placing ``le zarci'' before the selbri makes sure that it is properly associated
with both parts of the logical connection. Otherwise, it is easy to erroneously leave it
off one of the two sentences.)

    <p>It is wise, before freely doing transformations such as the one from <a href=
    "#e12d4">Example 12.4</a> to <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>, that you become
    familiar with expanding logical connectives to separate sentences, transforming the
    sentences, and then recondensing. Thus, you would prove the transformation correct by
    the following steps. By moving its ``na'' to the beginning of the prenex as a
    ``naku'', <a href="#e12d4">Example 12.4</a> becomes:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    naku zo'u la djein. le zarci
        ge dzukla gi bajrykla
    It is false that : Jane to-the market
        (both walks and runs).
</pre>

    <p>And by dividing the bridi with logically connected selbri into two bridi,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    naku zo'u ge la djein. le zarci dzukla
        gi la djein. le zarci bajrykla
    It-is-false-that: both (Jane to-the market walks)
        and (Jane to-the market runs).
</pre>is the result.

    <p>At this expanded level, we apply DeMorgan's Law to distribute the negation in the
    prenex across both sentences, to get</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d8" name="e12d8">12.8)</a>    ga la djein. le zarci na dzukla
        gi la djein. le zarci na bajrykla
    Either Jane to-the market [false] walks,
        or Jane to-the market [false] runs.
</pre>which is the same as
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d9" name="e12d9">12.9)</a>    ganai la djein. le zarci dzukla
        ginai la djein. le zarci bajrykla
    If Jane to-the market walks,
        then Jane to-the market [false] runs.
    If Jane walks to the market, then she doesn't run.
</pre>which then condenses down to <a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a>.

    <p>DeMorgan's Law must also be applied to internal ``naku'' negations:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e12d10" name="e12d10">12.10)</a>  ga la paris. gi la rom. naku se klama la djan.
    (Either Paris or Rome) is-not gone-to-by John.

    John doesn't go-to both Paris and Rome.
</pre>

    <p>That <a href="#e12d10">Example 12.10</a> and <a href="#e12d11">Example 12.11</a>
    mean the same should become evident by studying the English. It is a good exercise to
    work through the Lojban and prove that they are the same.</p>

be totally reworded in English. Furthermore, when a selbri variable appears in the
prenex, it is necessary to precede it with a quantifier such as ``su'o''; it is
ungrammatical to just say ``bu'a zo'u''. This rule is necessary because only sumti can
appear in the prenex, and ``su'o bu'a'' is technically a sumti --- in fact, an indefinite
description like ``re nanmu'', since ``bu'a'' is grammatically equivalent to a brivla
like ``nanmu''. However, indefinite descriptions involving the bu'a-series cannot be
imported from the prenex.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s14" name="s14">14. A few notes on variables</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-s14" name="s14">A variable may have a quantifier placed in front of it even
    though it has already been quantified explicitly or implicitly by a previous
    appearance, as in:</a></p>

    Three Xs which-are cats are white, and two Xs are big.
</pre>

    <p>What does <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a> mean? The appearance of ``ci da''
    quantifies ``da'' as referring to three things, which are restricted by the relative
    clause to be cats. When ``re da'' appears later, it refers to two of the those three
    things --- there is no saying which ones. Further uses of ``da'' alone, if there were
    any, would refer once more to the three cats, so the requantification of ``da'' is
    purely local.</p>

    <p>In general, the scope of a prenex that precedes a sentence extends to following
    sentences that are joined by ijeks (explained in <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter
    14</a>) such as the ``.ije'' in <a href="#e14d1">Example 14.1</a>. Theoretically, a
    bare ``.i'' terminates the scope of the prenex. Informally, however, variables may
    persist for a while even after an ``.i'', as if it were an ``.ije''. Prenexes that
    precede embedded bridi such as relative clauses and abstractions extend only to the
    end of the clause, as explained in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>. A prenex preceding
    ``tu'e ... tu'u'' long-scope brackets persists until the ``tu'u'', which may be many
    sentences or even paragraphs later.</p>

    <p>If the variables ``da'', ``de'', and ``di'' (or the selbri variables ``bu'a'',
    ``bu'e'', and ``bu'i'') are insufficient in number for handling a particular problem,
    the Lojban approach is to add a subscript to any of them. Each possible different
    combination of a subscript and a variable cmavo counts as a distinct variable in
    Lojban. Subscripts are explained in full in <a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>,
    but in general consist of the cmavo ``xi'' (of selma'o XI) followed by a number, one
    or more lerfu words forming a single string, or a general mathematical expression
    enclosed in parentheses.</p>

    <p>A quantifier can be prefixed to a variable that has already been bound either in a
    prenex or earlier in the bridi, thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-16-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    ci da poi prenu cu se ralju pa da
    Three Xs which are-persons are-led-by one-of X
    Three people are led by one of them.
</pre>

    <p>The ``pa da'' in <a href="#e14d2">Example 14.2</a> does not specify the number of
    things to which ``da'' refers, as the preceding ``ci da'' does. Instead, it selects
    one of them for use in this sumti only. The number of referents of ``da'' remains
    three, but a single one (there is no way of knowing which one) is selected to be the
    leader.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s1" name="s1">1. What's a letteral, anyway?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s1" name="s1">James Cooke Brown, the founder of the Loglan Project, coined
    the word ``letteral'' (by analogy with ``numeral'') to mean a letter of the alphabet,
    such as ``f'' or ``z''. A typical example of its use might be</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s1" name="s1"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e1d1" name=
"e1d1">1.1)</a>  There are fourteen occurrences of the letteral
        ``e'' in this sentence.
</pre>(Don't forget the one within quotation marks.) Using the word ``letteral'' avoids
confusion with ``letter'', the kind you write to someone. Not surprisingly, there is a
Lojban gismu for ``letteral'', namely ``lerfu'', and this word will be used in the rest
of this chapter.

    <p>Lojban uses the Latin alphabet, just as English does, right? Then why is there a
    need for a chapter like this? After all, everyone who can read it already knows the
    alphabet. The answer is twofold:</p>

    <p>First, in English there are a set of words that correspond to and represent the
    English lerfu. These words are rarely written down in English and have no standard
    spellings, but if you pronounce the English alphabet to yourself you will hear them:
    ay, bee, cee, dee ... . They are used in spelling out words and in pronouncing most
    acronyms. The Lojban equivalents of these words are standardized and must be
    documented somehow.</p>

    <p>Second, English has names only for the lerfu used in writing English. (There are
    also English names for Greek and Hebrew lerfu: English-speakers usually refer to the
    Greek lerfu conventionally spelled ``phi'' as ``fye'', whereas ``fee'' would more
    nearly represent the name used by Greek-speakers. Still, not all English-speakers
    know these English names.) Lojban, in order to be culturally neutral, needs a more
    comprehensive system that can handle, at least potentially, all of the world's
    alphabets and other writing systems.</p>

    <p>Letterals have several uses in Lojban: in forming acronyms and abbreviations, as
    mathematical symbols, and as pro-sumti --- the equivalent of English pronouns.</p>

    <p>In earlier writings about Lojban, there has been a tendency to use the word
    ``lerfu'' for both the letterals themselves and for the Lojban words which represent
    them. In this chapter, that tendency will be ruthlessly suppressed, and the term
    ``lerfu word'' will invariably be used for the latter. The Lojban equivalent would be
    ``lerfu valsi'' or ``lervla''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2">2. A to Z in Lojban, plus one</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2">The first requirement of a system of lerfu words for any
    language is that they must represent the lerfu used to write the language. The lerfu
    words for English are a motley crew: the relationship between ``doubleyou'' and ``w''
    is strictly historical in nature; ``aitch'' represents ``h'' but has no clear
    relationship to it at all; and ``z'' has two distinct lerfu words, ``zee'' and
    ``zed'', depending on the dialect of English in question.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2">All of Lojban's basic lerfu words are made by one of three
    rules:</a></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2"></a></dt>

      <dd><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2">to get a lerfu word for a vowel, add ``bu''; to get a
      lerfu word for a consonant, add ``y''; the lerfu word for ``''' is
      ``.y'y''.</a></dd>
    </dl><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s2" name="s2">Therefore, the following table represents the basic Lojban
    alphabet:</a>
    <pre>
   '   a   b   c   d   e
    .y'y.   .abu    by. cy. dy. .ebu

    f   g   i   j   k   l
    fy. gy. .ibu    jy. ky. ly.

    m   n   o   p   r   s
    my. ny. .obu    py. ry. sy.

    t   u   v   x   y   z
    ty. .ubu    vy. xy. .ybu    zy.
</pre>There are several things to note about this table. The consonant lerfu words are a
single syllable, whereas the vowel and ``''' lerfu words are two syllables and must be
preceded by pause (since they all begin with a vowel). Another fact, not evident from the
table but important nonetheless, is that ``by'' and its like are single cmavo of selma'o
BY, as is ``.y'y''. The vowel lerfu words, on the other hand, are compound cmavo, made
from a single vowel cmavo plus the cmavo ``bu'' (which belongs to its own selma'o, BU).
All of the vowel cmavo have other meanings in Lojban (logical connectives, sentence
separator, hesitation noise), but those meanings are irrelevant when ``bu'' follows.

    <p>Here are some illustrations of common Lojban words spelled out using the alphabet
    above:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  ty. .abu ny. ry. .ubu
    ``t'' ``a'' ``n'' ``r'' ``u''

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   ky. .obu .y'y. .abu
    ``k'' ``o'' ``''' ``a''
</pre>Spelling out words is less useful in Lojban than in English, for two reasons:
Lojban spelling is phonemic, so there can be no real dispute about how a word is spelled;
and the Lojban lerfu words sound more alike than the English ones do, since they are made
up systematically. The English words ``fail'' and ``vale'' sound similar, but just
hearing the first lerfu word of either, namely ``eff'' or ``vee'', is enough to
discriminate easily between them --- and even if the first lerfu word were somehow
confused, neither ``vail'' nor ``fale'' is a word of ordinary English, so the rest of the
spelling determines which word is meant. Still, the capability of spelling out words does
exist in Lojban.

    <p>Note that the lerfu words ending in ``y'' were written (in <a href="#e2d1">Example
    2.1</a> and <a href="#e2d2">Example 2.2</a>) with pauses after them. It is not
    strictly necessary to pause after such lerfu words, but failure to do so can in some
    cases lead to ambiguities:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>  mi cy. claxu
    I lerfu-``c'' without
    I am without (whatever is referred to by)
        the letter ``c''.
</pre>without a pause after ``cy'' would be interpreted as:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e2d4" name="e2d4">2.4)</a>  micyclaxu
    (Observative:) doctor-without
    Something unspecified is without a doctor.
</pre>

    <p>A safe guideline is to pause after any cmavo ending in ``y'' unless the next word
    is also a cmavo ending in ``y''. The safest and easiest guideline is to pause after
    all of them.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s3" name="s3">3. Upper and lower cases</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s3" name="s3">Lojban doesn't use lower-case (small) letters and upper-case
    (capital) letters in the same way that English does; sentences do not begin with an
    upper-case letter, nor do names. However, upper-case letters are used in Lojban to
    mark irregular stress within names, thus:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s3" name="s3"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  .iVAN.
    the name ``Ivan'' in Russian/Slavic pronunciation.
</pre>It would require far too many cmavo to assign one for each upper-case and one for
each lower-case lerfu, so instead we have two special cmavo ``ga'e'' and ``to'a''
representing upper case and lower case respectively. They belong to the same selma'o as
the basic lerfu words, namely BY, and they may be freely interspersed with them.

    <p>The effect of ``ga'e'' is to change the interpretation of all lerfu words
    following it to be the upper-case version of the lerfu. An occurrence of ``to'a''
    causes the interpretation to revert to lower case. Thus, ``ga'e .abu'' means not
    ``a'' but ``A'', and Ivan's name may be spelled out thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  .ibu ga'e vy. .abu ny. to'a
    i [upper] V A N [lower]
</pre>The cmavo and compound cmavo of this type will be called ``shift words''.

    <p>How long does a shift word last? Theoretically, until the next shift word that
    contradicts it or until the end of text. In practice, it is common to presume that a
    shift word is only in effect until the next word other than a lerfu word is
    found.</p>

    <p>It is often convenient to shift just a single letter to upper case. The cmavo
    ``tau'', of selma'o LAU, is useful for the purpose. A LAU cmavo must always be
    immediately followed by a BY cmavo or its equivalent: the combination is
    grammatically equivalent to a single BY. (See <a href="#s14">Section 14</a> for
    details.)</p>

    <p>A likely use of ``tau'' is in the internationally standardized symbols for the
    chemical elements. Each element is represented using either a single upper-case lerfu
    or one upper-case lerfu followed by one lower-case lerfu:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  tau sy.
    [single shift] S
    S (chemical symbol for sulfur)
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  tau sy. .ibu
    [single shift] S i
    Si (chemical symbol for silicon)
</pre>If a shift to upper-case is in effect when ``tau'' appears, it shifts the next
lerfu word only to lower case, reversing its usual effect.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s4" name="s4">4. The universal ``bu''</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s4" name="s4">So far we have seen ``bu'' only as a suffix to vowel cmavo to
    produce vowel lerfu words. Originally, this was the only use of ``bu''. In developing
    the lerfu word system, however, it proved to be useful to allow ``bu'' to be attached
    to any word whatsoever, in order to allow arbitrary extensions of the basic lerfu
    word set.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s4" name="s4">Formally, ``bu'' may be attached to any single Lojban word.
    Compound cmavo do not count as words for this purpose. The special cmavo ``ba'e'',
    ``za'e'', ``zei'', ``zo'', ``zoi'', ``la'o'', ``lo'u'', ``si'', ``sa'', ``su'', and
    ``fa'o'' may not have ``bu'' attached, because they are interpreted before ``bu''
    detection is done; in particular,</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s4" name="s4"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s4" name="s4"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  zo bu
    the word ``bu''
</pre>is needed when discussing ``bu'' in Lojban. It is also illegal to attach ``bu'' to
itself, but more than one ``bu'' may be attached to a word; thus ``.abubu'' is legal, if
ugly. (Its meaning is not defined, but it is presumably different from ``.abu''.) It does
not matter if the word is a cmavo, a cmene, or a brivla. All such words suffixed by
``bu'' are treated grammatically as if they were cmavo belonging to selma'o BY. However,
if the word is a cmene it is always necessary to precede and follow it by a pause,
because otherwise the cmene may absorb preceding or following words.

    <p>The ability to attach ``bu'' to words has been used primarily to make names for
    various logograms and other unusual characters. For example, the Lojban name for the
    ``happy face'' is ``.uibu'', based on the attitudinal ``.ui'' that means
    ``happiness''. Likewise, the ``smiley face'', written ``:-)'' and used on computer
    networks to indicate humor, is called ``zo'obu'' The existence of these names does
    not mean that you should insert ``.uibu'' into running Lojban text to indicate that
    you are happy, or ``zo'obu'' when something is funny; instead, use the appropriate
    attitudinal directly.</p>

    <p>Likewise, ``joibu'' represents the ampersand character, ``&amp;'', based on the
    cmavo ``joi'' meaning ``mixed and''. Many more such lerfu words will probably be
    invented in future.</p>

    <p>The ``.'' and ``,'' characters used in Lojbanic writing to represent pause and
    syllable break respectively have been assigned the lerfu words ``denpa bu''
    (literally, ``pause bu'') and ``slaka bu'' (literally, ``syllable bu''). The written
    space is mandatory here, because ``denpa'' and ``slaka'' are normal gismu with normal
    stress: ``denpabu'' would be a fu'ivla (word borrowed from another language into
    Lojban) stressed ``denPAbu''. No pause is required between ``denpa'' (or ``slaka'')
    and ``bu'', though.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s5" name="s5">5. Alien alphabets</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s5" name="s5">As stated in</a> <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, Lojban's goal
    of cultural neutrality demands a standard set of lerfu words for the lerfu of as many
    other writing systems as possible. When we meet these lerfu in written text
    (particularly, though not exclusively, mathematical text), we need a standard
    Lojbanic way to pronounce them.</p>

    <p>There are certainly hundreds of alphabets and other writing systems in use around
    the world, and it is probably an unachievable goal to create a single system which
    can express all of them, but if perfection is not demanded, a usable system can be
    created from the raw material which Lojban provides.</p>

    <p>One possibility would be to use the lerfu word associated with the language
    itself, Lojbanized and with ``bu'' added. Indeed, an isolated Greek ``alpha'' in
    running Lojban text is probably most easily handled by calling it ``.alfas. bu''.
    Here the Greek lerfu word has been made into a Lojbanized name by adding ``s'' and
    then into a Lojban lerfu word by adding ``bu''. Note that the pause after ``.alfas.''
    is still needed.</p>

    <p>Likewise, the easiest way to handle the Latin letters ``h'', ``q'', and ``w'' that
    are not used in Lojban is by a consonant lerfu word with ``bu'' attached. The
    following assignments have been made:</p>
    <pre>
       .y'y.bu     h
        ky.bu       q
        vy.bu       w
</pre>As an example, the English word ``quack'' would be spelled in Lojban thus:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  ky.bu .ubu .abu cy. ky.
    ``q'' ``u'' ``a'' ``c'' ``k''
</pre>Note that the fact that the letter ``c'' in this word has nothing to do with the
sound of the Lojban letter ``c'' is irrelevant; we are spelling an English word and
English rules control the choice of letters, but we are speaking Lojban and Lojban rules
control the pronunciations of those letters.

    <p>A few more possibilities for Latin-alphabet letters used in languages other than
    English:</p>
    <pre>
       ty.bu       &thorn; (thorn)
        dy.bu       &amp;edh; (edh)
        

However, this system is not ideal for all purposes.  For one thing, it is
verbose.  The native lerfu words are often quite long, and with ``bu'' added
they become even longer: the worst-case Greek lerfu word would be
``.Omikron. bu'', with four syllables and two mandatory pauses.  In addition,
alphabets that are used by many languages have separate sets of lerfu words
for each language, and which set is Lojban to choose?
</pre>The alternative plan, therefore, is to use a shift word similar to those introduced
in <a href="#s3">Section 3</a>. After the appearance of such a shift word, the regular
lerfu words are re-interpreted to represent the lerfu of the alphabet now in use. After a
shift to the Greek alphabet, for example, the lerfu word ``ty'' would represent not Latin
``t'' but Greek ``tau''. Why ``tau''? Because it is, in some sense, the closest
counterpart of ``t'' within the Greek lerfu system. In principle it would be all right to
map ``ty.'' to ``phi'' or even ``omega'', but such an arbitrary relationship would be
extremely hard to remember.

    <p>Where no obvious closest counterpart exists, some more or less arbitrary choice
    must be made. Some alien lerfu may simply not have any shifted equivalent, forcing
    the speaker to fall back on a ``bu'' form. Since a ``bu'' form may mean different
    things in different alphabets, it is safest to employ a shift word even when ``bu''
    forms are in use.</p>

    <p>Shifts for several alphabets have been assigned cmavo of selma'o BY:</p>
    <pre>
   lo'a    Latin/Roman/Lojban alphabet
    ge'o    Greek alphabet
    je'o    Hebrew alphabet
    jo'o    Arabic alphabet
    ru'o    Cyrillic alphabet
</pre>The cmavo ``zai'' (of selma'o LAU) is used to create shift words to still other
alphabets. The BY word which must follow any LAU cmavo would typically be a name
representing the alphabet with ``bu'' suffixed:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  zai .devanagar. bu
    Devanagari (Hindi) alphabet
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  zai .katakan. bu
    Japanese katakana syllabary
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  zai .xiragan. bu
    Japanese hiragana syllabary
</pre>Unlike the cmavo above, these shift words have not been standardized and probably
will not be until someone actually has a need for them. (Note the ``.'' characters
marking leading and following pauses.)

    <p>In addition, there may be multiple visible representations within a single
    alphabet for a given letter: roman vs. italics, handwriting vs. print, Bodoni vs.
    Helvetica. These traditional ``font and face'' distinctions are also represented by
    shift words, indicated with the cmavo ``ce'a'' (of selma'o LAU) and a following BY
    word:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ce'a .xelveticas. bu
    Helvetica font
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  ce'a .xancisk. bu
    handwriting
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ce'a .pavrel. bu
    12-point font size
</pre>The cmavo ``na'a'' (of selma'o BY) is a universal shift-word cancel: it returns the
interpretation of lerfu words to the default of lower-case Lojban with no specific font.
It is more general than ``lo'a'', which changes the alphabet only, potentially leaving
font and case shifts in place.

    <p>Several sections at the end of this chapter contain tables of proposed lerfu word
    assignments for various languages.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6">6. Accent marks and compound lerfu words</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6">Many languages that make use of the Latin alphabet add
    special marks to some of the lerfu they use. French, for example, uses three accent
    marks above vowels, called (in English) ``acute'', ``grave'', and ``circumflex''.
    Likewise, German uses a mark called ``umlaut''; a mark which looks the same is also
    used in French, but with a different name and meaning.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6">These marks may be considered lerfu, and each has a
    corresponding lerfu word in Lojban. So far, no problem. But the marks appear over
    lerfu, whereas the words must be spoken (or written) either before or after the lerfu
    word representing the basic lerfu. Typewriters (for mechanical reasons) and the
    computer programs that emulate them usually require their users to type the accent
    mark before the basic lerfu, whereas in speech the accent mark is often pronounced
    afterwards (for example, in German ``a umlaut'' is preferred to ``umlaut
    a'').</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6">Lojban cannot settle this question by fiat. Either it must be
    left up to default interpretation depending on the language in question, or the
    lerfu-word compounding cmavo ``tei'' (of selma'o TEI) and ``foi'' (of selma'o FOI)
    must be used. These cmavo are always used in pairs; any number of lerfu words may
    appear between them, and the whole is treated as a single compound lerfu word. The
    French word ``&eacute;t&eacute;'', with acute accent marks on both ``e'' lerfu, could
    be spelled as:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s6" name="s6"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e6d1" name=
"e6d1">6.1)</a>  tei .ebu .akut. bu foi ty. tei .akut. bu .ebu foi
    ( ``e'' acute ) ``t'' ( acute ``e'' )
</pre>and it does not matter whether ``akut. bu'' appears before or after ``.ebu''; the
``tei ... foi'' grouping guarantees that the acute accent is associated with the correct
lerfu. Of course, the level of precision represented by <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>
would rarely be required: it might be needed by a Lojban-speaker when spelling out a
French word for exact transcription by another Lojban-speaker who did not know French.

    <p>This system breaks down in languages which use more than one accent mark on a
    single lerfu; some other convention must be used for showing which accent marks are
    written where in that case. The obvious convention is to represent the mark nearest
    the basic lerfu by the lerfu word closest to the word representing the basic lerfu.
    Any remaining ambiguities must be resolved by further conventions not yet
    established.</p>

    <p>Some languages, like Swedish and Finnish, consider certain accented lerfu to be
    completely distinct from their unaccented equivalents, but Lojban does not make a
    formal distinction, since the printed characters look the same whether they are
    reckoned as separate letters or not. In addition, some languages consider certain
    2-letter combinations (like ``ll'' and ``ch'' in Spanish) to be letters; this may be
    represented by enclosing the combination in ``tei ... foi''.</p>

    <p>In addition, when discussing a specific language, it is permissible to make up new
    lerfu words, as long as they are either explained locally or well understood from
    context: thus Spanish ``ll'' or Croatian ``lj'' could be called ``libu'', but that
    usage would not necessarily be universally understood.</p>

    <p><a href="#s19">Section 19</a> contains a table of proposed lerfu words for some
    common accent marks.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">7. Punctuation marks</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">Lojban does not have punctuation marks as such: the denpa bu
    and the slaka bu are really a part of the alphabet. Other languages, however, use
    punctuation marks extensively. As yet, Lojban does not have any words for these
    punctuation marks, but a mechanism exists for devising them: the cmavo ``lau'' of
    selma'o LAU. ``lau'' must always be followed by a BY word; the interpretation of the
    BY word is changed from a lerfu to a punctuation mark. Typically, this BY word would
    be a name or brivla with a ``bu'' suffix.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">Why is ``lau'' necessary at all? Why not just use a
    ``bu''-marked word and announce that it is always to be interpreted as a punctuation
    mark? Primarily to avoid ambiguity. The ``bu'' mechanism is extremely open-ended, and
    it is easy for Lojban users to make up ``bu'' words without bothering to explain what
    they mean. Using the ``lau'' cmavo flags at least the most important of such nonce
    lerfu words as having a special function: punctuation. (Exactly the same argument
    applies to the use of ``zai'' to signal an alphabet shift or ``ce'a'' to signal a
    font shift.)</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">Since different alphabets require different punctuation
    marks, the interpretation of a ``lau''-marked lerfu word is affected by the current
    alphabet shift and the current font shift.</a></p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s8" name="s8">8. What about Chinese
    characters?</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">Chinese characters (``han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>'' in
    Chinese, ``kanji'' in Japanese) represent an entirely different approach to writing
    from alphabets or syllabaries. (A syllabary, such as Japanese hiragana or Amharic
    writing, has one lerfu for each syllable of the spoken language.) Very roughly,
    Chinese characters represent single elements of meaning; also very roughly, they
    represent single syllables of spoken Chinese. There is in principle no limit to the
    number of Chinese characters that can exist, and many thousands are in regular
    use.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">It is hopeless for Lojban, with its limited lerfu and shift
    words, to create an alphabet which will match this diversity. However, there are
    various possible ways around the problem.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7">First, both Chinese and Japanese have standard Latin-alphabet
    representations, known as ``pinyin'' for Chinese and ``romaji'' for Japanese, and
    these can be used. Thus, the word ``han<sup>4</sup>zi<sup>4</sup>'' is conventionally
    written with two characters, but it may be spelled out as:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s7" name="s7"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e8d1" name=
"e8d1">8.1)</a>  .y'y.bu .abu ny. vo zy. .ibu vo
    ``h'' ``a'' ``n'' 4 ``z'' ``i'' 4
</pre>The cmavo ``vo'' is the Lojban digit ``4''. It is grammatical to intersperse digits
(of selma'o PA) into a string of lerfu words; as long as the first cmavo is a lerfu word,
the whole will be interpreted as a string of lerfu words. In Chinese, the digits can be
used to represent tones. Pinyin is more usually written using accent marks, the mechanism
for which was explained in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>.

    <p>The Japanese company named ``Mitsubishi'' in English is spelled the same way in
    romaji, and could be spelled out in Lojban thus:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>  my. .ibu ty. sy. .ubu by. .ibu sy. .y'y.bu .ibu
    ``m'' ``i'' ``t'' ``s'' ``u'' ``b'' ``i'' ``s'' ``h'' ``i''
</pre>Alternatively, a really ambitious Lojbanist could assign lerfu words to the
individual strokes used to write Chinese characters (there are about seven or eight of
them if you are a flexible human being, or about 40 if you are a rigid computer program),
and then represent each character with a ``tei'', the stroke lerfu words in the order of
writing (which is standardized for each character), and a ``foi''. No one has as yet
attempted this project.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s9" name="s9">9. lerfu words as pro-sumti</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s9" name="s9">So far, lerfu words have only appeared in Lojban text when
    spelling out words. There are several other grammatical uses of lerfu words within
    Lojban. In each case, a single lerfu word or more than one may be used. Therefore,
    the term ``lerfu string'' is introduced: it is short for ``sequence of one or more
    lerfu words''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s9" name="s9">A lerfu string may be used as a pro-sumti (a sumti which
    refers to some previous sumti), just like the pro-sumti ``ko'a'', ``ko'e'', and so
    on:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s9" name="s9"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d1" name="e9d1">9.1)</a>  .abu prami by.
    A loves B
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a>, ``.abu'' and ``by.'' represent specific sumti,
    but which sumti they represent must be inferred from context.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, lerfu strings may be assigned by ``goi'', the regular pro-sumti
    assignment cmavo:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  le gerku goi gy. cu xekri .i gy. klama le zdani
    The dog, or G, is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>There is a special rule that sometimes makes lerfu strings more advantageous than
the regular pro-sumti cmavo. If no assignment can be found for a lerfu string (especially
a single lerfu word), it can be assumed to refer to the most recent sumti whose name or
description begins in Lojban with that lerfu. So <a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> can be
rephrased:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  le gerku cu xekri. .i gy. klama le zdani
    The dog is black.  G goes to the house.
</pre>(A less literal English translation would use ``D'' for ``dog'' instead.)

    <p>Here is an example using two names and longer lerfu strings:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  la stivn. mark. djonz. merko

    <p>Perhaps Alexander's name should be given as ``ru'o.abupyky'' instead.</p>

    <p>What about</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  .abu dunda by. cy.
    A gives B C
</pre>Does this mean that A gives B to C? No. ``by. cy.'' is a single lerfu string,
although written as two words, and represents a single pro-sumti. The true interpretation
is that A gives BC to someone unspecified. To solve this problem, we need to introduce
the elidable terminator ``boi'' (of selma'o BOI). This cmavo is used to terminate lerfu
strings and also strings of numerals; it is required when two of these appear in a row,
as here. (The other reason to use ``boi'' is to attach a free modifier --- subscript,
parenthesis, or what have you --- to a lerfu string.) The correct version is:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d6" name="e9d6">9.6)</a>  .abu [boi] dunda by. boi cy. [boi]
    A gives B to C
</pre>where the two occurrences of ``boi'' in brackets are elidable, but the remaining
occurrence is not. Likewise:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e9d7" name="e9d7">9.7)</a>  xy. boi ro [boi] prenu cu prami
    X all persons loves.
    X loves everybody.
</pre>requires the first ``boi'' to separate the lerfu string ``xy.'' from the digit
string ``ro''.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s10" name="s10">10. References to lerfu</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s10" name="s10">The rules of</a> <a href="#s9">Section 9</a> make it

</pre>the hearer would try to find what previous sumti ``.abu'' refers to. The solution
to this problem makes use of the cmavo ``me'o'' of selma'o LI, which makes a lerfu string
into a sumti representing that very string of lerfu. This use of ``me'o'' is a special
case of its mathematical use, which is to introduce a mathematical expression used

    <p>Since the Lojban sentence has only four ``e'' lerfu rather than fourteen, the
    translation is not a literal one --- but <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is a
    Lojban truth just as <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a> is an English truth.
    Coincidentally, the colloquial English translation of <a href="#e10d4">Example

    <p>The reader might be tempted to use quotation with ``lu ... li'u'' instead of

    explained in</a> <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>, so the mathematical uses of
    lerfu strings will be listed and exemplified but not explained.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string as mathematical variable:</p>

    the-number y equals the number the-function f of x
    y = f(x)
</pre>

    <p>Note the ``boi'' here to separate the lerfu strings ``fy'' and ``xy''.</p>

    <p>A lerfu string as selbri (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MOI):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    le vi ratcu ny.moi le'i mi ratcu
    the here rat is-nth-of the-set-of my rats
    This rat is my Nth rat.
</pre>A lerfu string as utterance ordinal (followed by a cmavo of selma'o MAI):
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    ny.mai
    Nthly
</pre>A lerfu string as subscript (preceded by ``xi'' of selma'o XI):
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    xy. xi ky.
    x sub k
</pre>A lerfu string as quantifier (enclosed in ``vei ... ve'o'' parentheses):
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    vei ny. [ve'o] lo prenu
    ( ``n'' ) persons
</pre>The parentheses are required because ``ny. lo prenu'' would be two separate sumti,
``ny.'' and ``lo prenu''. In general, any mathematical expression other than a simple
number must be in parentheses when used as a quantifier; the right parenthesis mark, the
cmavo ``ve'o'', can usually be elided.

    <p>All the examples above have exhibited single lerfu words rather than lerfu
    strings, in accordance with the conventions of ordinary mathematics. A longer lerfu
    string would still be treated as a single variable or function name: in Lojban,
    ``.abu by. cy.'' is not the multiplication ``a x b x c'' but is the variable ``abc''.
    (Of course, a local convention could exist that made the value of a variable like
    ``abc'', with a multi-lerfu-word name, equal to the values of the variables ``a'',
    ``b'', and ``c'' multiplied together.)</p>

    <p>There is a special rule about shift words in mathematical text: shifts within
    mathematical expressions do not affect lerfu words appearing outside</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s12" name="s12">12. Acronyms</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s12" name="s12">An acronym is a name constructed of lerfu. English examples
    are ``DNA'', ``NATO'', ``CIA''. In English, some of these are spelled out (like
    ``DNA'' and ``CIA'') and others are pronounced more or less as if they were ordinary
    English words (like ``NATO''). Some acronyms fluctuate between the two
    pronunciations: ``SQL'' may be ``ess cue ell'' or ``sequel''.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s12" name="s12">In Lojban, a name can be almost any sequence of sounds that
    ends in a consonant and is followed by a pause. The easiest way to Lojbanize acronym
    names is to glue the lerfu words together, using ``''' wherever two vowels would come
    together (pauses are illegal in names) and adding a final consonant:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s12" name="s12"></a></p>
    <pre>

    DNA. NATO.
    CIA. SQL.
    IBM. NYC.
</pre>There is no fixed convention for assigning the final consonant. In <a href=
"#e12d1">Example 12.1</a>, the last consonant of the lerfu string has been replicated
into final position.

    <p>Some compression can be done by leaving out ``bu'' after vowel lerfu words (except
    for ``.y.bu'', wherein the ``bu'' cannot be omitted without ambiguity). Compression
    is moderately important because it's hard to say long names without introducing an
    involuntary (and illegal) pause:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la dyny'am. .i la ny'aty'om.

    .i la .ibymym. .i la ny'ybucym.
    DNA. NATO.
    CIA. SQL.
    IBM. NYC.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e12d2">Example 12.2</a>, the final consonant ``m'' stands for
    ``merko'', indicating the source culture of these acronyms.</p>

    <p>Another approach, which some may find easier to say and which is compatible with
    older versions of the language that did not have a ``''' character, is to use the
    consonant ``z'' instead of ``''':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    la dynyzaz. .i la nyzatyzoz.

    .i la .ibymyz. .i la nyzybucyz.
    DNA. NATO.
    CIA. SQL.
    IBM. NYC.
</pre>One more alternative to these lengthy names is to use the lerfu string itself
prefixed with ``me'', the cmavo that makes sumti into selbri:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    la me dy ny. .abu
    that-named what-pertains-to ``d'' ``n'' ``a''
</pre>

    <p>This works because ``la'', the cmavo that normally introduces names used as sumti,
    may also be used before a predicate to indicate that the predicate is a (meaningful)
    name:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e12d5" name="e12d5">12.5)</a>    la cribe cu ciska
    that-named ``Bear'' writes
    Bear is a writer
</pre><a href="#e12d5">Example 12.5</a> does not of course refer to a bear (``le cribe''
or ``lo cribe'') but to something else, probably a person, named ``Bear''. Similarly,
``me dy ny. .abu'' is a predicate which can be used as a name, producing a kind of
acronym which can have pauses between the individual lerfu words.

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s13" name="s13">13. Computerized character codes</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-s13" name="s13">Since the first application of computers to non-numerical
    information, character sets have existed, mapping numbers (called ``character
    codes'') into selected lerfu, digits, and punctuation marks (collectively called
    ``characters''). Historically, these character sets have only covered the English
    alphabet and a few selected punctuation marks. International efforts are now underway
    to create a unified character set that can represent essentially all the characters
    in essentially all the world's writing systems. Lojban can take advantage of these
    encoding schemes by using the cmavo ``se'e'' (of selma'o BY). This cmavo is
    conventionally followed by digit cmavo of selma'o PA representing the character code,
    and the whole string indicates a single character in some computerized character
    set:</a></p>

    The character code 36 in ASCII represents
        American dollars.
    ``&amp;dollar;'' represents American dollars.
</pre>Understanding <a href="#e13d1">Example 13.1</a> depends on knowing the value in the
ASCII character set (one of the simplest and oldest) of the ``&amp;dollar;'' character.
Therefore, the ``se'e'' convention is only intelligible to those who know the underlying
character set. For precisely specifying a particular character, however, it has the
advantages of unambiguity and (relative) cultural neutrality, and therefore Lojban
provides a means for those with access to descriptions of such character sets to take
advantage of them.

    <p>As another example, the Unicode character set (also known as ISO 10646) represents
    the international symbol of peace, an inverted trident in a circle, using the base-16
    value 262E. In a suitable context, a Lojbanist may say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-17-e13d2" name="e13d2">13.2)</a>    me'o se'erexarerei sinxa le ka panpi

        the quality-of being-at-peace
</pre>When a ``se'e'' string appears in running discourse, some metalinguistic convention
must specify whether the number is base 10 (as above) or some other base, and which
character set is in use.

      -->
    </div>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s1" name="s1">lojbau mekso
    (``Lojbanic mathematical-expression'') is the part of the Lojban language that is
    tailored for expressing statements of a mathematical character, or for adding
    numerical information to non-mathematical statements. Its formal design goals
    include:</a>

    <dl>
      <dt>1)</dt>

      <dd>representing all the different forms of expression used by mathematicians in
      their normal modes of writing, so that a reader can unambiguously read off
      mathematical text as written with minimal effort and expect a listener to
      understand it;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>2)</dt>

      <dd>providing a vocabulary of commonly used mathematical terms which can readily be
      expanded to include newly coined words using the full resources of Lojban;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>3)</dt>

      <dd>permitting the formulation, both in writing and in speech, of unambiguous
      mathematical text;</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>4)</dt>

      <dd>encompassing all forms of quantified expression found in natural languages, as
      well as encouraging greater precision in ordinary language situations than natural
      languages allow.</dd>
    </dl>Goal 1 requires that mekso not be constrained to a single notation such as
    Polish notation or reverse Polish notation, but make provision for all forms, with
    the most commonly used forms the most easily used.

    <p>Goal 2 requires the provision of several conversion mechanisms, so that the
    boundary between mekso and full Lojban can be crossed from either side at many
    points.</p>

    <p>Goal 3 is the most subtle. Written mathematical expression is culturally
    unambiguous, in the sense that mathematicians in all parts of the world understand
    the same written texts to have the same meanings. However, international mathematical
    notation does not prescribe unique forms. For example, the expression</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e1d1" name="e1d1">1.1)</a>  3x + 2y
</pre>contains omitted multiplication operators, but there are other possible
interpretations for the strings ``3x'' and ``2y'' than as mathematical multiplication.
Therefore, the Lojban verbal (spoken and written) form of <a href="#e1d1">Example 1.1</a>
must not omit the multiplication operators.

    <p>The remainder of this chapter explains (in as much detail as is currently
    possible) the mekso system. This chapter is by intention complete as regards mekso
    components, but only suggestive about uses of those components --- as of now, there
    has been no really comprehensive use made of mekso facilities, and many matters must
    await the test of usage to be fully clarified.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s2" name="s2">2. Lojban numbers</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s2" name="s2">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s2" name="s2"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s2" name="s2">   pa  PA  1
    re  PA  2
    ci  PA  3
    vo  PA  4
    mu  PA  5
    xa  PA  6
    ze  PA  7
    bi  PA  8
    so  PA  9
    no  PA  0           
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s2" name="s2">The simplest kind of mekso are numbers, which are cmavo or
compound cmavo. There are cmavo for each of the 10 decimal digits, and numbers greater
than 9 are made by stringing together the cmavo. Some examples:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  pa re ci
    one two three
    123
    one hundred and twenty three

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e2d2" name="e2d2">2.2)</a>   pa no
    one zero
    10
    ten

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e2d3" name="e2d3">2.3)</a>   pa re ci vo mu xa ze bi so no
    one two three four five six seven eight nine zero
    1234567890
    one billion, two hundred and thirty-four million,
        five hundred and sixty-seven thousand,
        eight hundred and ninety.
</pre>Therefore, there are no separate cmavo for ``ten'', ``hundred'', etc.

    <p>There is a pattern to the digit cmavo (except for ``no'', 0) which is worth
    explaining. The cmavo from 1 to 5 end in the vowels ``a'', ``e'', ``i'', ``o'', ``u''
    respectively; and the cmavo from 6 to 9 likewise end in the vowels ``a'', ``e'',
    ``i'', and ``o'' respectively. None of the digit cmavo begin with the same consonant,
    to make them easy to tell apart in noisy environments.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s3" name="s3">3. Signs and numerical punctuation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s3" name="s3">   ma'u    PA  positive sign
    ni'u    PA  negative sign
    pi  PA  decimal point
    fi'u    PA  fraction slash
    ra'e    PA  repeating decimal
    ce'i    PA  percent sign
    ki'o    PA  comma between digits
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s3" name="s3">A number can be given an explicit sign by the use of ``ma'u''
and ``ni'u'', which are the positive and negative signs as distinct from the addition,
subtraction, and negation operators. For example:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d1" name="e3d1">3.1)</a>  ni'u pa
    negative-sign 1
    -1
</pre>Grammatically, the signs are part of the number to which they are attached. It is
also possible to use ``ma'u'' and ``ni'u'' by themselves as numbers; the meaning of these
numbers is explained in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>.

    <p>Various numerical punctuation marks are likewise expressed by cmavo, as
    illustrated in the following examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d2" name="e3d2">3.2)</a>  ci pi pa vo pa mu
    three point one four one five
    3.1415
</pre>(In some cultures, a comma is used instead of a period in the symbolic version of
<a href="#e3d2">Example 3.2</a>; ``pi'' is still the Lojban representation for the
decimal point.)
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d3" name="e3d3">3.3)</a>  re fi'u ze
    two fraction seven
    2/7
</pre><a href="#e3d3">Example 3.3</a> is the name of the number two-sevenths; it is not
the same as ``the result of 2 divided by 7'' in Lojban, although numerically these two
are equal. If the denominator of the fraction is present but the numerator is not, the
numerator is taken to be 1, thus expressing the reciprocal of the following number:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d4" name="e3d4">3.4)</a>  fi'u ze
    fraction seven
    1/7
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d5" name="e3d5">3.5)</a>  pi ci mu ra'e pa vo re bi mu ze
    point three five repeating one four two eight five seven
    .35142857142857...
</pre>Note that the ``ra'e'' marks unambiguously where the repeating portion ``142857''
begins.
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d6" name="e3d6">3.6)</a>  ci mu ce'i
    three five percent
    35%
</pre>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d7" name="e3d7">3.7)</a>  pa ki'o re ci vo ki'o mu xa ze
    one comma two three four comma five six seven
    1,234,567
</pre>(In some cultures, spaces are used in the symbolic representation of <a href=
"#e3d7">Example 3.7</a>; ``ki'o'' is still the Lojban representation.)

    <p>It is also possible to have less than three digits between successive ``ki'o''s,
    in which case zeros are assumed to have been elided:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d8" name="e3d8">3.8)</a>  pa ki'o re ci ki'o vo
    one comma two three comma four
    1,023,004
</pre>

    <p>In the same way, ``ki'o'' can be used after ``pi'' to divide fractions into groups
    of three:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d9" name="e3d9">3.9)</a>  pi ki'o re re
    point comma two two
    .022

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e3d10" name="e3d10">3.10)</a>   pi pa ki'o pa re ki'o pa
    point one comma one two comma one

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s4" name="s4">4. Special numbers</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s4" name="s4">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s4" name="s4"></a></p>

</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s5" name="s5">Let us begin at the beginning: one plus one equals two. In
Lojban, that sentence translates to:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  li pa su'i pa du li re
    the-number one plus one equals the-number two.
    1 + 1 = 2
</pre><a href="#e5d1">Example 5.1</a>, a mekso sentence, is a regular Lojban bridi that
exploits mekso features. ``du'' is the predicate meaning ``x1 is mathematically equal to
x2''. It is a cmavo for conciseness, but it has the same grammatical uses as any brivla.
Outside mathematical contexts, ``du'' means ``x1 is identical with x2'' or ``x1 is the
same object as x2''.

    <p>The cmavo ``li'' is the number article. It is required whenever a sentence talks
    about numbers as numbers, as opposed to using numbers to quantify things. For
    example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  le ci prenu
    the three persons
</pre>requires no ``li'' article, because the ``ci'' is being used to specify the number
of ``prenu''. However, the sentence
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  levi sfani cu grake li ci
    this fly masses-in-grams the-number three
    This fly has a mass of 3 grams.
</pre>requires ``li'' because ``ci'' is being used as a sumti. Note that this is the way
in which measurements are stated in Lojban: all the predicates for units of length, mass,
temperature, and so on have the measured object as the first place and a number as the
second place. Using ``li'' for ``le'' in <a href="#e5d2">Example 5.2</a> would produce
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  li ci prenu
    the-number 3 is-a-person
</pre>which is grammatical but nonsensical: numbers are not persons.

    <p>The cmavo ``su'i'' belongs to selma'o VUhU, which is composed of mathematical
    operators, and means ``addition''. As mentioned before, it is distinct from ``ma'u''
    which means the positive sign as an indication of a positive number:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  li ma'u pa su'i ni'u pa
        du li no
    the-number positive-sign one plus negative-sign one
        equals the-number zero
    +1 + -1 = 0
</pre>

    <p>Of course, it is legal to have complex mekso on both sides of ``du'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  li mu su'i pa
        du li ci su'i ci
    the-number five plus one
        equals the-number three plus three
    5 + 1 = 3 + 3
</pre>Why don't we say ``li mu su'i li pa'' rather than just ``li mu su'i pa''? The
answer is that VUhU operators connect mekso operands (numbers, in <a href="#e5d6">Example
5.6</a>), not general sumti. ``li'' is used to make the entire mekso into a sumti, which
then plays the roles applicable to other sumti: in <a href="#e5d6">Example 5.6</a>,
filling the places of a bridi.

    <p>By default, Lojban mathematics is like simple calculator mathematics: there is no
    notion of ``operator precedence''. Consider the following example, where ``pi'i''
    means ``times'', the multiplication operator:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  li ci su'i vo pi'i mu
        du li reci
    the-number three plus four times five
        equals the-number two-three
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 23
</pre>

    <p>Is the Lojban version of <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a> true? No! ``3 + 4 &times;
    5'' is indeed 23, because the usual conventions of mathematics state that
    multiplication takes precedence over addition; that is, the multiplication ``4
    &times; 5'' is done first, giving 20, and only then the addition ``3 + 20''. But VUhU
    operators by default are done left to right, like other Lojban grouping, and so a
    truthful bridi would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  li ci su'i vo pi'i mu
        du li cimu
    the-number three plus four times five
        equals the-number three-five
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 35
</pre>Here we calculate 3 + 4 first, giving 7, and then calculate 7 &times; 5 second,
leading to the result 35. While possessing the advantage of simplicity, this result
violates the design goal of matching the standards of mathematics. What can be done?

    <p>There are three solutions, all of which will probably be used to some degree. The
    first solution is to ignore the problem. People will say ``li ci su'i vo pi'i mu''
    and mean 23 by it, because the notion that multiplication takes precedence over
    addition is too deeply ingrained to be eradicated by Lojban parsing, which totally
    ignores semantics. This convention essentially allows semantics to dominate syntax in
    this one area.</p>

    <p>(Why not hard-wire the precedences into the grammar, as is done in computer
    programming languages? Essentially because there are too many operators, known and
    unknown, with levels of precedence that vary according to usage. The programming
    language 'C' has 13 levels of precedence, and its list of operators is not even
    extensible. For Lojban this approach is just not practical. In addition, hard-wired
    precedence could not be overridden in mathematical systems such as spreadsheets where
    the conventions are different.)</p>

    <p>The second solution is to use explicit means to specify the precedence of
    operators. This approach is fully general, but clumsy, and will be explained in
    <a href="#s20">Section 20</a>.</p>

    <p>The third solution is simple but not very general. When an operator is prefixed
    with the cmavo ``bi'e'' (of selma'o BIhE), it becomes automatically of higher
    precedence than other operators not so prefixed. Thus,</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  li ci su'i vo bi'e pi'i mu
        du li reci
    the-number three plus four-times-five
        equals the-number two-three
    3 + 4 &times; 5 = 23
</pre>is a truthful Lojban bridi. If more than one operator has a ``bi'e'' prefix,
grouping is to the right; multiple ``bi'e'' prefixes on a single operator are not
allowed.

    <p>In addition, of course, Lojban has the mathematical parentheses ``vei'' and
    ``ve'o'', which can be used just like their written equivalents ``('' and ``)'' to
    group expressions in any way desired:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e5d10" name=
"e5d10">5.10)</a>    li vei ny. su'i pa ve'o pi'i vei ny. su'i pa [ve'o]
        du li ny. [bi'e] te'a re su'i re bi'e pi'i ny. su'i pa
    the-number ( ``n'' plus one ) times ( ``n'' plus one )
        equals the-number n-power-two plus two-times-``n'' plus 1
    (n + 1)(n + 1) = n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 1
</pre>There are several new usages in <a href="#e5d10">Example 5.10</a>: ``te'a'' means
``raised to the power'', and we also see the use of the lerfu word ``ny'', representing
the letter ``n''. In mekso, letters stand for just what they do in ordinary mathematics:
variables. The parser will accept a string of lerfu words (called a ``lerfu string'') as
the equivalent of a single lerfu word, in agreement with computer-science conventions;
``abc'' is a single variable, not the equivalent of ``a &times; b &times; c''. (Of
course, a local convention could state that the value of a variable like ``abc'', with a
multi-lerfu name, was equal to the values of the variables ``a'', ``b'', and ``c''
multiplied together.)

    <p>The explicit operator ``pi'i'' is required in the Lojban verbal form whereas
    multiplication is implicit in the symbolic form. Note that ``ve'o'' (the right
    parenthesis) is an elidable terminator: the first use of it in <a href=
    "#e5d10">Example 5.10</a> is required, but the second use (marked by square brackets)
    could be elided. Additionally, the first ``bi'e'' (also marked by square brackets) is
    not necessary to get the proper grouping, but it is included here for symmetry with
    the other one.</p>

    fy. BY  letter ``f''
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s6" name="s6">The infix form explained so far is reasonable for many
purposes, but it is limited and rigid. It works smoothly only where all operators have
exactly two operands, and where precedences can either be assumed from context or are
limited to just two levels, with some help from parentheses.</a>

    <p>But there are many operators which do not have two operands, or which have a
    variable number of operands. The preferred form of expression in such cases is the
    use of ``forethought operators'', also known as Polish notation. In this style of
    writing mathematics, the operator comes first and the operands afterwards:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  li su'i paboi reboi ci[boi] du li xa
    the-number the-sum-of one two three equals the-number six
    sum(1,2,3) = 6
</pre>Note that the normally elidable number terminator ``boi'' is required after ``pa''
and ``re'' because otherwise the reading would be ``pareci'' = 123. It is not required
after ``ci'' but is inserted here in brackets for the sake of symmetry. The only time
``boi'' is required is, as in <a href="#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>, when there are two
consecutive numbers or lerfu strings.

    <p>Forethought mekso can use any number of operands, in <a href="#e6d1">Example
    6.1</a> three. How do we know how many operands there are in ambiguous circumstances?
    The usual Lojban solution is employed: an elidable terminator, namely ``ku'e''. Here
    is an example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  li py. su'i va'a ny. ku'e su'i zy du li xy.
    the-number ``p'' plus negative-of( ``n'' ) plus ``z''
        equals the-number ``x''
    p + -n + z = x
</pre>where we know that ``va'a'' is a forethought operator because there is no operand
preceding it.

    <p>``va'a'' is the numerical negation operator, of selma'o VUhU. In contrast, j
    ``vu'u'' is not used for numerical negation, but only for subtraction, as it always
    has two or more operands. Do not confuse ``va'a'' and ``vu'u'', which are operators,
    with ``ni'u'', which is part of a number.</p>

    <p>In <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a>, the operator ``va'a'' and the terminator
    ``ku'e'' serve in effect as parentheses. (The regular parentheses ``vei'' and
    ``ve'o'' are NOT used for this purpose.) If the ``ku'e'' were omitted, the ``su'i
    zy'' would be swallowed up by the ``va'a'' forethought operator, which would then
    appear to have two operands, ``ny'' and ``su'i zy.'', where the latter is also a
    forethought expression.</p>

    <p>Forethought mekso is also useful for matching standard functional notation. How do
    we represent ``z = f(x)''? The answer is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  li zy du li ma'o fy.boi xy.
    the-number z equals the-number the-operator f x
    z = f(x)
</pre>Again, no parentheses are used. The construct ``ma'o fy.boi'' is the equivalent of
an operator, and appears in forethought here (although it could also be used as a regular
infix operator). In mathematics, letters sometimes mean functions and sometimes mean
variables, with only the context to tell which. Lojban chooses to accept the variable
interpretation as the default, and uses the special flag ``ma'o'' to mark a lerfu string
as an operator. The cmavo ``xy.'' and ``zy.'' are variables, but ``fy.'' is an operator
(a function) because ``ma'o'' marks it as such. The ``boi'' is required because otherwise
the ``xy.'' would look like part of the operator name. (The use of ``ma'o'' can be
generalized from lerfu strings to any mekso operand: see <a href="#s21">Section 21</a>.)

    <p>When using forethought mekso, the optional marker ``pe'o'' may be placed in front
    of the operator. This usage can help avoid confusion by providing clearly marked
    ``pe'o'' and ``ku'e'' pairs to delimit the operand list. <a href="#e6d1">Examples
    6.1</a> to <a href="#e6d3">6.3</a>, respectively, with explicit ``pe'o'' and
    ``ku'e'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  li pe'o su'i paboi reboi ciboi ku'e du li xa

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>   li zy du li pe'o ma'o fy.boi xy. ku'e
</pre>Note: When using forethought mekso, be sure that the operands really are operands:
they cannot contain regular infix expressions unless parenthesized with ``vei'' and
``ve'o''. An earlier version of the complex <a href="#e17d6">Example 17.6</a> came to
grief because I forgot this rule.

indefinite numbers between ``ro'' and ``no'', with a built-in ordering. In particular,
``so'e'' does not mean ``most'' in the sense of ``a majority'' or ``more than half''.

    <p>Each of these numbers, plus ``ro'', may be prefixed with ``pi'' (the decimal
    point) in order to make a fractional form which represents part of a whole rather

exactly six superpowers (``rairgugde'', ``superlative-states'') in the world, then ``ro
rairgugde'' means the same as ``xa rairgugde''. It is often useful, however, to express
subjective indefinite values. The cmavo ``rau'' (enough), ``du'e'' (too many), and
``mo'a'' (too few) are then appropriate:

    <p>The four cmavo ``su'e'', ``su'o'', ``me'i'', and ``za'u'', also of selma'o PA,
    express inexact numbers with upper or lower bounds:</p>

</pre>Each of these is a subtly different claim: <a href="#e9d7">Example 9.7</a> is true
of two or any greater number, whereas <a href="#e9d9">Example 9.9</a> requires three
persons or more. Likewise, <a href="#e9d6">Example 9.6</a> refers to zero, one, or two;
<a href="#e9d8">Example 9.8</a> to zero or one. (Of course, when the context allows
numbers other than non-negative integers, ``me'i re'' can be any number less than 2, and
likewise with the other cases.) The exact quantifier, ``exactly 2, neither more nor
less'' is just ``re''. Note that ``su'ore'' is the exact Lojban equivalent of English
plurals.

    <p>If no number follows one of these cmavo, ``pa'' is understood: therefore,</p>

    <p>Like the numbers in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>, all of these cmavo may be
    preceded by ``pi'' to make the corresponding quantifiers for part of a whole. For
    example, ``pisu'o'' means ``at least some part of''. The quantifiers ``ro'',
    ``su'o'', ``piro'', and ``pisu'o'' are particularly important in Lojban, as they are
    implicitly used in the descriptions introduced by the cmavo of selma'o LA and LE, as

</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s10" name="s10">In normal contexts, Lojban assumes that all numbers are
expressed in the decimal (base 10) system. However, other bases are possible, and may be
appropriate in particular circumstances.</a>

    <p>To specify a number in a particular base, the VUhU operator ``ju'u'' is
    suitable:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    li pa no pa no ju'u re du li pa no
    the-number 1010 base 2 equals the-number 10
</pre>Here, the final ``pa no'' is assumed to be base 10, as usual; so is the base
specification. (The base may also be changed permanently by a metalinguistic
specification; no standard way of doing so has as yet been worked out.)

    <p>Lojban has digits for representing bases up to 16, because 16 is a base often used
    in computer applications. In English, it is customary to use the letters A-F as the
    base 16 digits equivalent to the numbers ten through fifteen. In Lojban, this
    ambiguity is avoided:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    li daufeigai ju'u paxa du li rezevobi

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a> li jaureivai ju'u paxa du li cimuxaze
    the-number DEF base 16 equals the-number 3567
</pre>Note the pattern in the cmavo: the diphthongs ``au'', ``ei'', ``ai'' are used twice
in the same order. The digits for A to D use consonants different from those used in the
decimal digit cmavo; E and F unfortunately overlap 2 and 4 --- there was simply not
enough available cmavo space to make a full differentiation possible. The cmavo are also
in alphabetical order.

    <p>The base point ``pi'' is used in non-decimal bases just as in base 10:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a>    li vai pi bi ju'u paxa du li pamu pi mu
    the-number F.8 base 16 equals the-number 15.5
</pre>Since ``ju'u'' is an operator of selma'o VUhU, it is grammatical to use any operand
as the left argument. Semantically, however, it is undefined to use anything but a
numeral string on the left. The reason to make ``ju'u'' an operator is to allow reference
to a base which is not a constant.

    <p>There are some numerical values that require a ``base'' that varies from digit to
    digit. For example, times represented in hours, minutes, and seconds have, in effect,
    three ``digits'': the first is base 24, the second and third are base 60. To express
    such numbers, the compound base separator ``pi'e'' is used:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    ci pi'e rere pi'e vono
    3:22:40
</pre>Each digit sequence separated by instances of ``pi'e'' is expressed in decimal
notation, but the number as a whole is not decimal and can only be added and subtracted
by special rules:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    li ci pi'e rere pi'e vono su'i pi'e ci pi'e cici
        du li ci pi'e rexa pi'e paci
    the-number 3:22:40 plus :3:33 equals the-number 3:26:13
    3:22:40 + 0:3:33 = 3:26:13
</pre>

    <p>Of course, only context tells you that the first part of the numbers in <a href=
    "#e10d5">Example 10.5</a> and <a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a> is hours, the second
    minutes, and the third seconds.</p>

    <p>The same mechanism using ``pi'e'' can be used to express numbers which have a base
    larger than 16. For example, base-20 Mayan mathematics might use digits from ``no''
    to ``paso'', each separated by ``pi'e'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    li pa pi'e re pi'e ci ju'u reno du li vovoci
    the-number 1;2;3 base 20 equals the-number 443
</pre>Carefully note the difference between:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d8" name="e10d8">10.8)</a>    pano ju'u reno
    the-digit-10 base 20
</pre>which is equal to ten, and:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    pa pi'e no ju'u reno
    1;0 base 20
</pre>which is equal to twenty.

    <p>Both ``pi'' and ``pi'e'' can be used to express large-base decimal fractions:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e10d10" name=
"e10d10">10.10)</a>  li pa pi'e vo pi ze ju'u reno du li re vo pi ci mu
    the-number 1;4.7 base 20 equals the-number 24.35
</pre>``pi'e'' is also used where the base of each digit is vague, as in the numbering of
the examples in this chapter:

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s11" name="s11">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    me'u    MEhU    terminator for ME
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s11" name="s11">Lojban possesses a special category of selbri which are
based on mekso. The simplest kind of such selbri are made by suffixing a member of
selma'o MOI to a number. There are four members of MOI, each of which serves to create
number-based selbri with specific place structures.</a>

    <p>``-mei'' creates cardinal selbri. The basic place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is a mass formed from the set x2 of n members, one or more of which is/are
      x3</dd>
    </dl>A cardinal selbri interrelates a set with a given number of members, the mass
    formed from that set, and the individuals which make the set up. The mass argument is
    placed first as a matter of convenience, not logical necessity.

    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d1" name="e11d1">11.1)</a>    lei mi ratcu cu cimei
    those-I-describe-as-the-mass-of my rats are-a-threesome.
    My rats are three.
    I have three rats.
</pre>

    <p>Here, the mass of my rats is said to have three components; that is, I have three
    rats.</p>

    <p>Another example, with one element this time:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    mi poi pamei cu cusku dei
    I who am-an-individual express this-sentence.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e11d2">Example 11.2</a>, ``mi'' refers to a mass, ``the mass
    consisting of me''. Personal pronouns are vague between masses, sets, and
    individuals.</p>

    <p>However, when the number expressed before ``-mei'' is an objective indefinite
    number of the kind explained in <a href="#s8">Section 8</a>, a slightly different
    place structure is required:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is a mass formed from a set x2 of n members, one or more of which is/are x3,
      measured relative to the set x4.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>An example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d3" name="e11d3">11.3)</a>    lei ratcu poi zvati le panka cu so'umei
        fo lo'i ratcu
    the-mass-of rats which are-in the park are a-fewsome
        with-respect-to the-set-of rats.
    The rats in the park are a small number
        of all the rats there are.
</pre>In <a href="#e11d3">Example 11.3</a>, the x2 and x3 places are vacant, and the x4
place is filled by ``lo'i ratcu'', which (because no quantifiers are explicitly given)
means ``the whole of the set of all those things which are rats'', or simply ``the set of
all rats.''
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    le'i ratcu poi zvati le panka cu se so'imei
    The-set-of rats which-are in the park is-a manysome.
    There are many rats in the park.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e11d4">Example 11.4</a>, the conversion cmavo ``se'' swaps the x1 and
    the x2 places, so that the new x1 is the set. The x4 set is unspecified, so the
    implication is that the rats are ``many'' with respect to some unspecified comparison
    set.</p>

    <p>More explanations about the interrelationship of sets, masses, and individuals can
    be found in <a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

    <p>``-moi'' creates ordinal selbri. The place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is the (n)th member of set x2 when ordered by rule x3</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    ti pamoi le'i mi ratcu

</pre><a href="#e11d7">Example 11.7</a> means, in the appropriate context, that my
position in line is sufficiently far to the front that I will get a seat for the movie.

    <p>``-si'e'' creates portion selbri. The place structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is an (n)th portion of mass x2</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d8" name="e11d8">11.8)</a>    levi sanmi cu fi'ucisi'e lei mi djedi cidja
    This-here meal is-a-slash-three-portion-of my day-food.
    This meal is one-third of my daily food.
</pre>``-cu'o'' creates probability selbri. The place structure is:

    <dl>
      <dd>event x1 has probability (n) of occurring under conditions x2</dd>
    </dl>The number must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d9" name="e11d9">11.9)</a>    le nu lo sicni cu sedja'o cu pimucu'o
    The event of a coin being a head-displayer
        has probability .5.
</pre>``-va'e'' creates a scale selbri. The place structure is:

    <dl>
      <dd>x1 is at scale position (n) on the scale x2</dd>
    </dl>If the scale is granular rather than continuous, a form like ``cifi'uxa'' (3/6)
    may be used; in this case, 3/6 is not the same as 1/2. Here is an example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d10" name="e11d10">11.10)</a>  le vi rozgu cu sofi'upanova'e xunre
    This rose is 8/10-scale red
    This rose is 8 out of 10 on the scale of redness.
    This rose is very red.
</pre>When the quantifier preceding any MOI cmavo includes the subjective numbers
``rau'', ``du'e'', or ``mo'a'' (enough, too many, too few) then an additional place is
added for ``by standard''. For example:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d11" name="e11d11">11.11)</a>  le ratcu poi zvati le panka cu du'emei fo mi
    The rats which-are in the park are too-many
        by-standard me.
    There are too many rats in the park for me.
</pre>The extra place (which for ``-mei'' is the x4 place labeled by ``fo'') is provided
rather than using a BAI tag such as ``ma'i'' because a specification of the standard for
judgment is essential to the meaning of subjective words like ``enough''.

    <p>This place is not normally explicit when using one of the subjective numbers
    directly as a number. Therefore, ``du'e ratcu'' means ``too many rats'' without
    specifying any standard.</p>

    <p>It is also grammatical to substitute a lerfu string for a number:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d12" name="e11d12">11.12)</a>  ta ny.moi le'i mi ratcu
    that is-nth-of the-set-of my rats
    That is my nth rat.
</pre>More complex mekso cannot be placed directly in front of MOI, due to the resulting
grammatical ambiguities. Instead, a somewhat artificial form of expression is required.

    <p>The cmavo ``me'' (of selma'o ME) has the function of making a sumti into a selbri.
    It is often used to make a name into a predicate:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e11d13" name="e11d13">11.13)</a>  ti me la nu,IORK. [me'u]

</pre>A whole ``me'' construction can have a member of MOI added to the end to create a

    that is the-number n plus one-th-of the-set-of my rats.
    That is my (n+1)-th rat.
</pre>

    <p>Here the mekso ``ny. su'i pa'' is made into a sumti (with ``li'') and then changed
    into a mekso selbri with ``me'' and ``me'u moi''. The elidable terminator ``me'u'' is
    required here in order to keep the ``pa'' and the ``moi'' separate; otherwise, the
    parser will combine them into the compound ``pamoi'' and reject the sentence as
    ungrammatical.</p>

    <p>It is perfectly possible to use non-numerical sumti after ``me'' and before a

</pre>Note: the elidable terminator ``boi'' is not used between a number and a member of
MOI. As a result, the ``me'u'' in <a href="#e11d14">Example 11.14</a> could also be
replaced by a ``boi'', which would serve the same function of preventing the ``pa'' and
``moi'' from joining into a compound.

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s14" name="s14">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s14" name="s14">   tu'o    PA  null operand
    ge'a    VUhU    null operator
    gei VUhU    exponential notation
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s14" name="s14">The infix operators presented so far have always had exactly
two operands, and for more or fewer operands forethought notation has been required.
However, it is possible to use an operator in infix style even though it has more or
fewer than two operands, through the use of a pair of tricks: the null operand ``tu'o''
and the null operator ``ge'a''. The first is suitable when there are too few operands,
the second when there are too many. For example, suppose we wanted to express the
numerical negation operator ``va'a'' in infix form. We would use:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e14d1" name="e14d1">14.1)</a>    li tu'o va'a ny. du
        li no vu'u ny.
    the-number (null) additive-inverse n equals
        the-number zero minus n
    -n = 0 - n
</pre>The ``tu'o'' fulfills the grammatical requirement for a left operand for the infix
use of ``va'a'', even though semantically none is needed or wanted.

    <p>Finding a suitable example of ``ge'a'' requires exhibiting a ternary operator, and
    ternary operators are not common. The operator ``gei'', however, has both a binary
    and a ternary use. As a binary operator, it provides a terse representation of
    scientific (also called ``exponential'') notation. The first operand of ``gei'' is
    the exponent, and the second operand is the mantissa or fraction:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e14d2" name="e14d2">14.2)</a>    li cinonoki'oki'o
        du li bi gei ci
    the-number three-zero-zero-comma-comma
        equals the-number eight scientific three.
    300,000,000 = 3 &times; 10<sup>8</sup>
</pre>Why are the arguments to ``gei'' in reverse order from the conventional symbolic
notation? So that ``gei'' can be used in forethought to allow easy specification of a
large (or small) imprecise number:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e14d3" name="e14d3">14.3)</a>    gei reno
    (scientific) two-zero
    10<sup>20</sup>
</pre>Note, however, that although 10 is far and away the most common exponent base, it
is not the only possible one. The third operand of ``gei'', therefore, is the base, with
10 as the default value. Most computers internally store so-called ``floating-point''
numbers using 2 as the exponent base. (This has nothing to do with the fact that
computers also represent all integers in base 2; the IBM 360 series used an exponent base
of 16 for floating point, although each component of the number was expressed in base 2.)
Here is a computer floating-point number with a value of 40:

    <p>``jo'i'', the only cmavo of selma'o JOhI, is the vector indicator: it has a syntax
    reminiscent of a forethought operator, but has very high precedence. The components
    must be simple operands rather than full expressions (unless parenthesized). A vector
    can have any number of components; ``te'u'' is the elidable terminator. An
    example:</p>

        equals the-number array( four, six)
    (1,2) + (3,4) = (4,6)
</pre>Vectors can be combined into matrices using either ``pi'a'', the matrix row
operator, or ``sa'i'', the matrix column operator. The first combines vectors
representing rows of the matrix, and the second combines vectors representing columns of
the matrix. Both of them allow any number of arguments: additional arguments are tacked
on with the null operator ``ge'a''.

    <p>Therefore, the ``magic square'' matrix</p>

        , the-vector (6 7 2)
</pre>The regular mekso operators can be applied to vectors and to matrices, since
grammatically both of these are expressions. It is usually necessary to parenthesize
matrices when used with operators in order to avoid incorrect groupings. There are no
VUhU operators for the matrix operators of inner or outer products, but appropriate
operators can be created using a suitable symbolic lerfu word or string prefixed by
``ma'o''.

    <p>Matrices of more than two dimensions can be built up using either ``pi'a'' or
    ``sa'i'' with an appropriate subscript numbering the dimension. When subscripted,
    there is no difference between ``pi'a'' and ``sa'i''.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s16" name="s16">16. Reverse Polish notation</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s16" name="s16">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s16" name="s16">   fu'a    FUhA    reverse Polish flag
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-s16" name="s16">So far, the Lojban notational conventions have mapped fairly
familiar kinds of mathematical discourse. The use of forethought operators may have
seemed odd when applied to ``+'', but when applied to ``f('' they appear as the usual
functional notation. Now comes a sharp break. Reverse Polish (RP) notation represents
something completely different; even mathematicians don't use it much. (The only common
uses of RP, in fact, are in some kinds of calculators and in the implementation of some
programming languages.)</a>

    <p>In RP notation, the operator follows the operands. (Polish notation, where the
    operator precedes its operands, is another name for forethought mekso of the kind
    explained in <a href="#s6">Section 6</a>.) The number of operands per operator is
    always fixed. No parentheses are required or permitted. In Lojban, RP notation is
    always explicitly marked by a ``fu'a'' at the beginning of the expression; there is
    no terminator. Here is a simple example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e16d1" name="e16d1">16.1)</a>    li fu'a reboi ci su'i
        du li mu
    the-number (RP!) two, three, plus
        equals the-number five.
</pre>

    <p>The operands are ``re'' and ``ci''; the operator is ``su'i''.</p>

    <p>Here is a more complex example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e16d2" name="e16d2">16.2)</a>    li fu'a reboi ci pi'i
        voboi mu pi'i su'i
        du li rexa
    the-number (RP!) (two, three, times),
        (four, five, times), plus
        equals the-number two-six
</pre>

    <p>Here the operands of the first ``pi'i'' are ``re'' and ``ci''; the operands of the
    second ``pi'i'' are ``vo'' and ``mu'' (with ``boi'' inserted where needed), and the
    operands of the ``su'i'' are ``reboi ci pi'i'', or 6, and ``voboi mu pi'i'', or 20.
    As you can see, it is easy to get lost in the world of reverse Polish notation; on
    the other hand, it is especially easy for a mechanical listener (who has a deep
    mental stack and doesn't get lost) to comprehend.</p>

    <p>The operands of an RP operator can be any legal mekso operand, including
    parenthesized mekso that can contain any valid syntax, whether more RP or something
    more conventional.</p>

    <p>In Lojban, RP operators are always parsed with exactly two operands. What about
    operators which require only one operand, or more than two operands? The null operand
    ``tu'o'' and the null operator ``ge'a'' provide a simple solution. A one-operand
    operator like ``va'a'' always appears in a reverse Polish context as ``tu'o va'a''.
    The ``tu'o'' provides the second operand, which is semantically ignored but
    grammatically necessary. Likewise, the three-operand version of ``gei'' appears in
    reverse Polish as ``ge'a gei'', where the ``ge'a'' effectively merges the 2nd and 3rd
    operands into a single operand. Here are some examples:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e16d3" name="e16d3">16.3)</a>    li fu'a ciboi muboi vu'u
        du li fu'a reboi tu'o va'a

for logical connectives within both operators and operands. Full details on logical and
non-logical connectives are provided in</a> <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>.
Operands are connected in afterthought with selma'o A and in forethought with selma'o GA,
just like sumti. Operators are connected in afterthought with selma'o JA and in
forethought with selma'o GUhA, just like tanru components. This parallelism is no
accident.

    <p>In addition, A+BO and A+KE constructs are allowed for grouping logically connected
    operands, and ``ke ... ke'e'' is allowed for grouping logically connected operators,
    although there are no analogues of tanru among the operators.</p>

    <p>Despite the large number of rules required to support this feature, it is of
    relatively minor importance in the mekso scheme of things. <a href="#e17d1">Example
    17.1</a> exhibits afterthought logical connection between operands:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e17d1" name="e17d1">17.1)</a>    vei ci .a vo ve'o prenu cu klama le zarci

</pre><a href="#e17d2">Example 17.2</a> is equivalent in meaning, but uses forethought
connection:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e17d2" name="e17d2">17.2)</a>    vei ga ci gi vo ve'o prenu cu klama le zarci
    ( either 3 or 4 ) people go-to the market.
</pre>Note that the mekso here are being used as quantifiers. Lojban requires that any
mekso other than a simple number be enclosed in parentheses when used as a quantifier.
This rule prevents ambiguities that do not exist when using ``li''.

    <p>By the way, ``li'' has an elidable terminator, ``lo'o'', which is needed when a
    ``li'' sumti is followed by a logical connective that could seem to be within the
    mekso. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e17d3" name="e17d3">17.3)</a>    li re su'i re du
        li vo lo'o .onai lo nalseldjuno namcu
    the-number two plus two equals
        the-number four or else a non-known number.
</pre>

    <p>Omitting the ``lo'o'' would cause the parser to assume that another operand
    followed the ``.onai'' and reject ``lo'' as an invalid operand.</p>

    <p>Simple examples of logical connection between operators are hard to come by. A
    contrived example is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e17d4" name="e17d4">17.4)</a>    li re su'i je pi'i re du li vo
    the-number two plus and times two equals the-number four.
    2 + 2 = 4 and 2 &times; 2 = 4.
</pre>

    <p>The forethought-connection form of <a href="#e17d4">Example 17.4</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-18-e17d5" name="e17d5">17.5)</a>    li re ge su'i gi pi'i re
        du li vo
    the-number two both plus and times two
        equals the-number four.
    Both 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 &times; 2 = 4.

</pre>Note the mixture of styles in <a href="#e17d6">Example 17.6</a>: the negation of b
and the square root are represented by forethought and most of the operator precedence by
prefixed ``bi'e'', but explicit parentheses had to be added to group the numerator
properly. In addition, the square root parentheses cannot be removed here in favor of
simple ``fe'a'' and ``ku'e'' bracketing, because infix operators are present in the
operand. Getting <a href="#e17d6">Example 17.6</a> to parse perfectly using the current

cmavo and just let the standard precedence rules be understood.

    <p><sub>Members of selma'o NAhE are also legal on an operator to produce a scalar
    negation of it. The implication is that some other operator would apply to make the

    loosely.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>``la'e'' and ``lu'e'' can be used on operands with the usual semantics to get
    the referent of or a symbol for an operand. Likewise, a member of selma'o NAhE
    followed by ``bo'' serves to scalar-negate an operand, implying that some other

Furthermore, although the cmavo ``fi'u'' does not have a rafsi as such, it is closely
related to the gismu ``frinu'', meaning ``fraction''; therefore, in a context of numeric
rafsi, you can use any of the rafsi for ``frinu'' to indicate a fraction slash.</sub>

    <p><sub>A similar convention is used for the cmavo ``cu'o'' of selma'o MOI, which is

    <p><sub>The grammar of mekso as described so far imposes a rigid distinction between
    operators and operands. Some flavors of mathematics (lambda calculus, algebra of
    functions) blur this distinction, and Lojban must have a method of doing the same. An
    operator can be changed into an operand with ``ni'enu'a'', which transforms the
    operator into a matching selbri and then the selbri into an operand.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>To change an operand into an operator, we use the cmavo ``ma'o'', already

    ``te'u'' if necessary.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>There is a potential semantic ambiguity in ``ma'o fy. [te'u]'' if ``fy.'' is
    already in use as a variable: it comes to mean ``the function whose value is always

    There are remnants of base-20 arithmetic in some languages, notably French, in which

      Putting It All Together: Notes on the Structure of Lojban Texts</h1>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">1. Introductory</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">This chapter is incurably miscellaneous. It describes the
    cmavo that specify the structure of Lojban texts, from the largest scale (paragraphs)
    to the smallest (single words). There are fewer examples than are found in other
    chapters of this book, since the linguistic mechanisms described are generally made
    use of in conversation or else in long documents.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">This chapter is also not very self-contained. It makes
    passing reference to a great many concepts which are explained in full only in other
    chapters. The alternative would be a chapter on text structure which was as complex
    as all the other chapters put together. Lojban is a unified language, and it is not
    possible to understand any part of it (in full) before understanding every part of it
    (to some degree).</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1"></a></p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s2" name="s2">2. Sentences: I</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1"></a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">       .i  I   sentence separator
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s1" name="s1">Since Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic, there needs to be a
spoken and written way of signaling the end of a sentence and the start of the following
one. In written English, a period serves this purpose; in spoken English, a tone contour
(rising or falling) usually does the job, or sometimes a long pause. Lojban uses a single
separator: the cmavo ``.i'' (of selma'o I):</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e2d1" name="e2d1">2.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci .i do cadzu le bisli
    I go to-the store.  You walk on-the ice.
</pre>The word ``separator'' should be noted. ``.i'' is not normally used after the last
sentence nor before the first one, although both positions are technically grammatical.
``.i'' signals a new sentence on the same topic, not necessarily by the same speaker. The
relationship between the sentences is left vague, except in stories, where the
relationship usually is temporal, and the following sentence states something that
happened after the previous sentence.

    <p>Note that although the first letter of an English sentence is capitalized, the
    cmavo ``.i'' is never capitalized. In writing, it is appropriate to place extra space
    before ``.i'' to make it stand out better for the reader. In some styles of Lojban
    writing that have been used so far, every ``.i'' is placed at the beginning of a
    line, possibly leaving space at the end of the previous line.</p>

    <p>An ``.i'' cmavo may or may not be used when the speaker of the following sentence
    is different from the speaker of the preceding sentence, depending on whether the
    sentences are felt to be connected or not.</p>

    <p>An ``.i'' cmavo can be compounded with a logical or non-logical connective (a jek
    or joik), a modal or tense connective, or both: these constructs are explained in
    <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>, <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>, and
    <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. In all cases, the ``.i'' comes first in the
    compound. Attitudinals can also be attached to an ``.i'' if they are meant to apply
    to the whole sentence: see <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

    <p>There exist a pair of mechanisms for binding a sequence of sentences closely
    together. If the ``.i'' (with or without connectives) is followed by ``bo'' (of
    selma'o BO), then the two sentences being separated are understood to be more closely
    grouped than sentences connected by ``.i'' alone.</p>

    <p>Similarly, a group of sentences can be preceded by ``tu'e'' (of selma'o TUhE) and
    followed by ``tu'u'' (of selma'o TUhU) to fuse them into a single unit. A common use
    of ``tu'e ... tu'u'' is to group the sentences which compose a poem: the title
    sentence would precede the group, separated from it by ``.i''. Another use might be a
    set of directions, where each numbered direction might be surrounded by ``tu'e ...
    tu'u'' and contain one or more sentences separated by ``.i''. Grouping with ``tu'e''
    and ``tu'u'' is analogous to grouping with ``ke'' and ``ke'e'' to establish the scope
    of logical or non-logical connectives (see <a href="chapter14.html">Chapter
    14</a>).</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">3. Paragraphs: NIhO</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">   ni'o    NIhO    new topic
    no'i    NIhO    old topic
    da'o    DAhO    cancel cmavo assignments
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">The paragraph is a concept used in writing systems for two
    purposes: to indicate changes of topic, and to break up the hard-to-read appearance
    of large blocks of text on the page. The former function is represented in both
    spoken and written Lojban by the cmavo ``ni'o'' and ``no'i'', both of selma'o NIhO.
    Of these two, ``ni'o'' is the more common. By convention, written Lojban is broken
    into paragraphs just before any ``ni'o'' or ``no'i'', but a very long passage on a
    single topic might be paragraphed before an ``.i''. On the other hand, it is
    conventional in English to start a new paragraph in dialogue when a new speaker
    starts, but this convention is not commonly observed in Lojban dialogues. Of course,
    none of these conventions affect meaning in any way.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">A ``ni'o'' can take the place of an ``.i'' as a sentence
    separator, and in addition signals a new topic or paragraph. Grammatically, any
    number of ``ni'o'' cmavo can appear consecutively and are equivalent to a single one;
    semantically, a greater number of ``ni'o'' cmavo indicates a larger-scale change of
    topic. This feature allows complexly structured text, with topics, subtopics, and
    sub-subtopics, to be represented clearly and unambiguously in both spoken and written
    Lojban. However, some conventional differences do exist between ``ni'o'' in writing
    and in conversation.</a></p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s3" name="s3">In written text, a single ``ni'o'' is a mere discursive
    indicator of a new subject, whereas ``ni'oni'o'' marks a change in the context. In
    this situation, ``ni'oni'o'' implicitly cancels the definitions of all pro-sumti of
    selma'o KOhA as well as pro-bridi of selma'o GOhA. (Explicit cancelling is expressed
    by the cmavo ``da'o'' of selma'o DAhO, which has the free grammar of an indicator --
    it can appear almost anywhere.) The use of ``ni'oni'o'' does not affect indicators
    (of selma'o UI) or tense references, but ``ni'oni'oni'o'', indicating a drastic
    change of topic, would serve to reset both indicators and tenses. (See</a> <a href=
    "#s8">Section 8</a> for a discussion of indicator scope.)</p>

    <p>In spoken text, which is inherently less structured, these levels are reduced by
    one, with ``ni'o'' indicating a change in context sufficient to cancel pro-sumti and
    pro-bridi assignment. On the other hand, in a book, or in stories within stories such
    as ``The Arabian Nights'', further levels may be expressed by extending the ``ni'o''
    string as needed. Normally, a written text will begin with the number of ``ni'o''
    cmavo needed to signal the largest scale division which the text contains. ``ni'o''
    strings may be subscripted to label each context of discourse: see <a href=
    "#s6">Section 6</a>.</p>

    <p>``no'i'' is similar in effect to ``ni'o'', but indicates the resumption of a
    previous topic. In speech, it is analogous to (but much shorter than) such English
    discursive phrases as ``But getting back to the point ... ''. By default, the topic
    resumed is that in effect before the last ``ni'o''. When subtopics are nested within
    topics, then ``no'i'' would resume the previous subtopic and ``no'ino'i'' the
    previous topic. Note that ``no'i'' also resumes tense and pro-sumti assignments
    dropped at the previous ``ni'o''.</p>

    <p>If a ``ni'o'' is subscripted, then a ``no'i'' with the same subscript is assumed
    to be a continuation of it. A ``no'i'' may also have a negative subscript, which
    would specify counting backwards a number of paragraphs and resuming the topic found
    thereby.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s4" name="s4">4. Topic-comment sentences: ZOhU</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s4" name="s4">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s4" name="s4">   zo'u    ZOhU    topic/comment separator
</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s4" name="s4">The normal Lojban sentence is just a bridi, parallel to the
    normal English sentence which has a subject and a predicate:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s4" name="s4"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d1" name="e4d1">4.1)</a>  mi klama le zarci
    I went to the market
</pre>In Chinese, the normal sentence form is different: a topic is stated, and a comment
about it is made. (Japanese also has the concept of a topic, but indicates it by
attaching a suffix; other languages also distinguish topics in various ways.) The topic
says what the sentence is about:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d2" name=
"e4d2">4.2)</a>  zhe<sup>4</sup> xiao<sup>1</sup>xi<sup>2</sup>   wo<sup>3</sup> zhi<sup>1</sup>dao le
    this news   I know [perfective]
    As for this news, I knew it.
    I've heard this news already.
</pre>The wide space in the first two versions of <a href="#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>
separate the topic (``this news'') from the comment (``I know already'').

    <p>Lojban uses the cmavo ``zo'u'' (of selma'o ZOhU) to separate topic (a sumti) from
    comment (a bridi):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d3" name="e4d3">4.3)</a>  le nuzba zu'o mi ba'o djuno
    The news : I [perfective] know.
</pre><a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a> is the literal Lojban translation of <a href=
"#e4d2">Example 4.2</a>. Of course, the topic-comment structure can be changed to a
straightforward bridi structure:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d4" name="e4d4">4.4)</a>  mi ba'o djuno le nuzba
    I [perfective] know the news.
</pre><a href="#e4d4">Example 4.4</a> means the same as <a href="#e4d3">Example 4.3</a>,
and it is simpler. However, often the position of the topic in the place structure of the
selbri within the comment is vague:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d5" name="e4d5">4.5)</a>  le finpe zo'u citka
    the fish : eat
</pre>

    <p>Is the fish eating or being eaten? The sentence doesn't say. The Chinese
    equivalent of <a href="#e4d5">Example 4.5</a> is:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d6" name="e4d6">4.6)</a>  yu<sup>2</sup> chi<sup>1</sup>
    fish   eat
</pre>which is vague in exactly the same way.

    <p>Grammatically, it is possible to have more than one sumti before ``zo'u''. This is
    not normally useful in topic-comment sentences, but is necessary in the other use of
    ``zo'u'': to separate a quantifying section from a bridi containing quantified
    variables. This usage belongs to a discussion of quantifier logic in Lojban (see
    <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>), but an example would be:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d7" name="e4d7">4.7)</a>  roda poi prenu ku'o su'ode zo'u
        de patfu da
    for-all X which-are-persons, there-exists-a-Y such-that
        Y is the father of X.
    Every person has a father.
</pre>

    <p>The string of sumti before ``zo'u'' (called the ``prenex'': see <a href=
    "chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>) may contain both a topic and bound variables:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d8" name="e4d8">4.8)</a>  loi patfu
        roda poi prenu ku'o su'ode zo'u
        de patfu da
    for-the-mass-of fathers
        for-all X which-are-persons, there-exists-a-Y such-that
        Y is the father of X.
    As for fathers, every person has one.
</pre>To specify a topic which affects more than one sentence, wrap the sentences in
``tu'e ... tu'u'' brackets and place the topic and the ``zo'u'' directly in front. This
is the exception to the rule that a topic attaches directly to a sentence:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d9" name="e4d9">4.9)</a>  loi jdini zo'u tu'e do ponse .inaja do djica [tu'u]
    the-mass-of money :  ( [if] you possess, then you want )
    Money: if you have it, you want it.
</pre>

    <p>Note: In Lojban, you do not ``want money''; you ``want to have money'' or
    something of the sort, as the x2 place of ``djica'' demands an event. As a result,
    the straightforward rendering of <a href="#e4d8">Example 4.8</a> without a topic is
    not:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d10" name="e4d10">4.10)</a>    do ponse loi jdini .inaja do djica ri
    You possess money only-if you desire its-mere-existence
</pre>where ``ri'' means ``loi jdini'' and is interpreted as ``the mere existence of
money'', but rather:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e4d11" name="e4d11">4.11)</a>    do ponse loi jdini .inaja do djica tu'a ri
    You possess money only-if you desire something-about it
</pre>namely, the possession of money. But topic-comment sentences like <a href="#e4d9">
    Example 4.9</a> are inherently vague, and this difference between ``ponse'' (which
    expects a physical object in x2) and ``djica'' is ignored. See <a href=
    "#e9d3">Example 9.3</a> for another topic/comment sentence.

    <p>The subject of an English sentence is often the topic as well, but in Lojban the
    sumti in the x1 place is not necessarily the topic, especially if it is the normal
    (unconverted) x1 for the selbri. Thus Lojban sentences don't necessarily have a
    ``subject'' in the English sense.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s5" name="s5">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>

    cu'e    CUhE    tense/modal question
    pau UI  question premarker
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s5" name="s5">Lojban questions are not at all like English questions. There
are two basic types: truth questions, of the form ``Is it true that ... '', and
fill-in-the-blank questions. Truth questions are marked by preceding the bridi, or
following any part of it specifically questioned, with the cmavo ``xu'' (of selma'o
UI):</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d1" name="e5d1">5.1)</a>  xu do klama le zarci
    [True or false?] You go to the store
    Are you going to the store/Did you go to the store?
</pre>(Since the Lojban is tenseless, either colloquial translation might be correct.)
Truth questions are further discussed in <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>.

    <p>Fill-in-the-blank questions have a cmavo representing some Lojban word or phrase
    which is not known to the questioner, and which the answerer is to supply. There are
    a variety of cmavo belonging to different selma'o which provide different kinds of
    blanks.</p>

    <p>Where a sumti is not known, a question may be formed with ``ma'' (of selma'o
    KOhA), which is a kind of pro-sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d2" name="e5d2">5.2)</a>  ma klama le zarci
    [What sumti?] goes-to the store
    Who is going to the store?
</pre>

    <p>Of course, the ``ma'' need not be in the x1 place:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d3" name="e5d3">5.3)</a>  do klama ma
    You go-to [what sumti?]
    Where are you going?
</pre>

    <p>The answer is a simple sumti:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d4" name="e5d4">5.4)</a>  le zarci
    The store.
</pre>

    <p>A sumti, then, is a legal utterance, although it does not by itself constitute a
    bridi -- it does not claim anything, but merely completes the open-ended claim of the
    previous bridi.</p>

    <p>There can be two ``ma'' cmavo in a single question:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d5" name="e5d5">5.5)</a>  ma klama ma
    Who goes where?
</pre>and the answer would be two sumti, which are meant to fill in the two ``ma'' cmavo
in order:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d6" name="e5d6">5.6)</a>  mi le zarci
    I, to the store.
</pre>An even more complex example, depending on the non-logical connective ``fa'u'' (of
selma'o JOI), which is like the English ``and ... respectively'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d7" name="e5d7">5.7)</a>  ma fa'u ma klama ma fa'u ma
    Who and who goes where and where, respectively?
</pre>

    <p>An answer might be</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d8" name="e5d8">5.8)</a>  la djan. la marcas. le zarci le briju
    John, Marsha, the store, the office.
    John and Marsha go to the store and the office,
        respectively.
</pre>(Note: A mechanical substitution of <a href="#e5d8">Example 5.8</a> into
    <a href="#e5d7">Example 5.7</a> produces an ungrammatical result, because ``* ... le
    zarci fa'u le briju'' is ungrammatical Lojban: the first ``le zarci'' has to be
    closed with its proper terminator ``ku'', for reasons explained in <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>. This effect is not important: Lojban behaves as if
    all elided terminators have been supplied in both question and answer before
    inserting the latter into the former. The exchange is grammatical if question and
    answer are each separately grammatical.)

    <p>Questions to be answered with a selbri are expressed with ``mo'' of selma'o GOhA,
    which is a kind of pro-bridi:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d9" name="e5d9">5.9)</a>  la lojban. mo
    Lojban [what selbri?]
    What is Lojban?
</pre>Here the answerer is to supply some predicate which is true of Lojban. Such
questions are extremely open-ended, due to the enormous range of possible predicate
answers. The answer might be just a selbri, or might be a full bridi, in which case the
sumti in the answer override those provided by the questioner. To limit the range of a
``mo'' question, make it part of a tanru.

    <p>Questions about numbers are expressed with ``xo'' of selma'o PA:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d10" name="e5d10">5.10)</a>    do viska xo prenu
    You saw [what number?] persons.
    How many people did you see?
</pre>

    <p>The answer would be a simple number, another kind of non-bridi utterance:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e5d11" name="e5d11">5.11)</a>    vomu
    Forty-five.
</pre>

    <p>Fill-in-the-blank questions may also be asked about: logical connectives (using
    cmavo ``ji'' of A, ``ge'i'' of GA, ``gi'i'' of GIhA, ``gu'i'' of GUhA, or ``je'i'' of
    JA, and receiving an ek, gihek, ijek, or ijoik as an answer) --- see <a href=
    "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>; attitudes (using ``pei'' of UI, and receiving an
    attitudinal as an answer) --- see <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>; place
    structures (using ``fi'a'' of FA, and receiving a cmavo of FA as an answer) --- see
    <a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>; tenses and modals (using ``cu'e'' of CUhE, and
    receiving any tense or BAI cmavo as an answer) --- see <a href=
    "chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a> and <a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

    <p>Questions can be marked by placing ``pau'' (of selma'o UI) before the question
    bridi. See <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a> for details.</p>

    <p>The full list of non-bridi utterances suitable as answers to questions is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>any number of sumti (with elidable terminator ``vau'', see <a href=
      "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>) an ek or gihek (logical connectives, see <a href=
      "chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>) a number, or any mathematical expression placed in
      parentheses (see <a href="chapter18.html">Chapter 18</a>) a bare ``na'' negator (to
      negate some previously expressed bridi), or corresponding ``ja'a'' affirmer (see
      <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>) a relative clause (to modify some
      previously expressed sumti, see <a href="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</a>) a
      prenex/topic (to modify some previously expressed bridi, see <a href=
      "chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>) linked arguments (beginning with ``be'' or ``bei''
      and attached to some previously expressed selbri, often in a description,see
      <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>At the beginning of a text, the following non-bridi are also permitted:</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>one or more names (to indicate direct address without ``doi'', see <a href=
      "chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>) indicators (to express a prevailing attitude, see
      <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>) ``nai'' (to vaguely negate something or
      other, see <a href="chapter15.html">Chapter 15</a>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Where not needed for the expression of answers, most of these are made grammatical
    for pragmatic reasons: people will say them in conversation, and there is no reason
    to rule them out as ungrammatical merely because most of them are vague.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s6" name="s6">6. Subscripts: XI</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s6" name="s6">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s6" name="s6">   xi  XI  subscript
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s6" name="s6">The cmavo ``xi'' (of selma'o XI) indicates that a subscript (a
number, a lerfu string, or a parenthesized mekso) follows. Subscripts can be attached to
almost any construction and are placed following the construction (or its terminator
word, which is generally required). They are useful either to extend the finite cmavo
list to infinite length, or to make more refined distinctions than the standard cmavo
list permits. The remainder of this section mentions some places where subscripts might
naturally be used.</a>

    <p>Lojban gismu have at most five places:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d1" name="e6d1">6.1)</a>  mi cu klama le zarci le zdani
        le dargu le karce
    I go to-the market from-the house
        via-the road using-the car.
</pre>

    <p>Consequently, selma'o SE (which operates on a selbri to change the order of its
    places) and selma'o FA (which provides place number tags for individual sumti) have
    only enough members to handle up to five places. Conversion of <a href=
    "#e6d1">Example 6.1</a>, using ``xe'' to swap the x1 and x5 places, would
    produce:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d2" name="e6d2">6.2)</a>  le karce cu xe klama le zarci
        le zdani le dargu mi
    The car is-a-transportation-means to-the market
        from-the house via-the road for-me.
</pre>

    <p>And reordering of the place structures might produce:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d3" name="e6d3">6.3)</a>  fo le dargu fi le zdani fa mi fe le zarci
        fu le karce cu klama
    Via the road, from the house, I, to the market,
        using-the car, go.
</pre><a href="#e6d1">Examples 6.1</a> to <a href="#e6d3">6.3</a> all mean the same
thing. But consider the lujvo ``nunkla'', formed by applying the abstraction operator
``nu'' to ``klama'':
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d4" name="e6d4">6.4)</a>  la'edi'u cu nunkla
        mi le zarci le zdani
        le dargu le karce
    The-referent-of-the-previous-sentence is-an-event-of-going
        by-me to-the market from-the house
        via-the road using-the car.
</pre><a href="#e6d4">Example 6.4</a> shows that ``nunkla'' has six places: the five
places of ``klama'' plus a new one (placed first) for the event itself. Performing
transformations similar to that of <a href="#e6d2">Example 6.2</a> requires an additional
conversion cmavo that exchanges the x1 and x6 places. The solution is to use any cmavo of
SE with a subscript:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d5" name="e6d5">6.5)</a>  le karce cu sexixa nunkla
        mi le zarci le zdani le dargu
        la'edi'u
    The car is-a-transportation-means-in-the-event-of-going
        by-me to-the market via-the road
        which-is-referred-to-by-the-last-sentence.
</pre>

    <p>Likewise, a sixth place tag can be created by using any cmavo of FA with a
    subscript:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d6" name="e6d6">6.6)</a>   fu le dargu fo le zdani fe mi
        fa la'edi'u fi le zarci
        faxixa le karce cu klama
    Via the road, from the house, by me,
        the-referent-of-the-last-sentence, to the market,
        using the car, is-an-event-of-going.
</pre><a href="#e6d4">Examples 6.4</a> to <a href="#e6d6">6.6</a> also all mean the same
thing, and each is derived straightforwardly from any of the others, despite the tortured
nature of the English glosses. In addition, any other member of SE or FA could be
substituted into ``sexixa'' and ``faxixa'' without change of meaning: ``vexixa'' means
the same thing as ``sexixa''.

    <p>Lojban provides two groups of pro-sumti, both belonging to selma'o KOhA. The
    ko'a-series cmavo are used to refer to explicitly specified sumti to which they have
    been bound using ``goi''. The da-series, on the other hand, are existentially or
    universally quantified variables. (These concepts are explained more fully in
    <a href="chapter16.html">Chapter 16</a>.) There are ten ko'a-series cmavo and 3
    da-series cmavo available.</p>

    <p>If more are required, any cmavo of the ko'a-series or the da-series can be
    subscripted:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d7" name="e6d7">6.7)</a>  daxivo
    X sub 4
</pre>is the 4th bound variable of the 1st sequence of the da-series, and
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d8" name="e6d8">6.8)</a>  ko'ixipaso
    something-3 sub 18
</pre>is the 18th free variable of the 3rd sequence of the ko'a-series. This convention
allows 10 sequences of ko'a-type pro-sumti and 3 sequences of da-type pro-sumti, each
with arbitrarily many members. Note that ``daxivo'' and ``dexivo'' are considered to be
distinct pro-sumti, unlike the situation with ``sexixa'' and ``vexixa'' above. Exactly
similar treatment can be given to the bu'a-series of selma'o GOhA and to the gismu
pro-bridi ``broda'', ``brode'', ``brodi'', ``brodo'', and ``brodu''.

    <p>Subscripts on lerfu words are used in the standard mathematical way to extend the
    number of variables:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d9" name="e6d9">6.9)</a>  li xy.boixipa du li xy.boixire su'i xy.boixici
    The-number x-sub-1 equals the-number x-sub-2 plus x-sub-3
    $x<sub>1</sub>  = x<sub>2</sub>  + x<sub>3</sub>$
</pre>and can be used to extend the number of pro-sumti as well, since lerfu strings
outside mathematical contexts are grammatically and semantically equivalent to pro-sumti
of the ko'a-series. (In <a href="#e6d9">Example 6.9</a>, note the required terminator
``boi'' after each ``xy.'' cmavo; this terminator allows the subscript to be attached
without ambiguity.)

    <p>Names, which are similar to pro-sumti, can also be subscripted to distinguish two
    individuals with the same name:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d10" name=
"e6d10">6.10)</a>    la djan. xipa cusku lu mi'enai do li'u la djan. xire
    John<sub>1</sub> expresses ``I-am-not you'' to John<sub>2</sub>.
</pre>Subscripts on tenses allow talking about more than one time or place that is
described by the same general cmavo. For example, ``puxipa'' could refer to one point in
the past, and ``puxire'' a second point (earlier or later).

    <p>You can place a subscript on the word ``ja'a'', the bridi affirmative of selma'o
    NA, to express so-called fuzzy truths. The usual machinery for fuzzy logic
    (statements whose truth value is not merely ``true'' or ``false'', but is expressed
    by a number in the range 0 to 1) in Lojban is the abstractor ``jei'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d11" name="e6d11">6.11)</a>    li pimu jei mi ganra
    The-number .5 is-the-truth-value-of my being-broad
</pre>

    <p>However, by convention we can attach a subscript to ``ja'a'' to indicate fuzzy
    truth (or to ``na'' if we change the amount):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e6d12" name="e6d12">6.12)</a>    mi ja'a xipimu ganra
    I truly-sub-.5 am-broad
</pre>Finally, as mentioned in <a href="#s2">Section 2</a>, ``ni'o'' and ``no'i'' cmavo
with matching subscripts mark the start and the continuation of a given topic
respectively. Different topics can be assigned to different subscripts.

    <p>Other uses of subscripts will doubtless be devised in future.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s7" name="s7">7. Utterance ordinals: MAI</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s7" name="s7">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s7" name="s7">   mai MAI utterance ordinal, -thly
    mo'o    MAI higher order utterance ordinal
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s7" name="s7">Numerical free modifiers, corresponding to English
``firstly'', ``secondly'', and so on, can be created by suffixing ``mai'' or ``mo'o'' of
selma'o MAI to a number or a lerfu string. Here are some examples:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e7d1" name="e7d1">7.1)</a>  mi klama pamai le zarci .e remai le zdani
    I go-to (firstly) the store and (secondly) the market.
</pre>

    <p>This does not imply that I go to the store before I go to the market: that meaning
    requires a tense. The sumti are simply numbered for convenience of reference. Like
    other free modifiers, the utterance ordinals can be inserted almost anywhere in a
    sentence without affecting its grammar or its meaning.</p>

    <p>Any of the Lojban numbers can be used with MAI: ``romai'', for example, means
    ``all-thly'' or ``lastly''. Likewise, if you are enumerating a long list and have
    forgotten which number is wanted next, you can say ``ny.mai'', or ``Nthly''.</p>

    <p>The difference between ``mai'' and ``mo'o'' is that ``mo'o'' enumerates larger
    subdivisions of a text; ``mai'' was designed for lists of numbered items, whereas
    ``mo'o'' was intended to subdivide structured works. If this chapter were translated
    into Lojban, it might number each section with ``mo'o'': this section would then be
    introduced with ``zemo'o'', or ``<a href="#s7">Section 7</a>.''</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s8" name="s8">8. Attitude scope markers: FUhE/FUhO</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s8" name="s8">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s8" name="s8">   fu'e    FUhE    open attitudinal scope
    fu'o    FUhO    close attitudinal scope
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s8" name="s8">Lojban has a complex system of ``attitudinals'', words which
indicate the speaker's attitude to what is being said. The attitudinals include
indicators of emotion, intensity markers, discursives (which show the structure of
discourse), and evidentials (which indicate ``how the speaker knows''). Most of these
words belong to selma'o UI; the intensity markers belong to selma'o CAI for historical
reasons, but the two selma'o are grammatically identical. The individual cmavo of UI and
CAI are discussed in</a> <a href="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>; only the rules for
applying them in discourse are presented here.

    <p>Normally, an attitudinal applies to the preceding word only. However, if the
    preceding word is a structural cmavo which begins or ends a whole construction, then
    that whole construction is affected by the attitudinal:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d1" name="e8d1">8.1)</a>  mi viska le blanu .ia zdani [ku]
    I see the blue [belief] house.
    I see the house, which I believe to be blue.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d2" name="e8d2">8.2)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani .ia [ku]
    I see the blue house [belief].
    I see the blue thing, which I believe to be a house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d3" name="e8d3">8.3)</a>   mi viska le .ia blanu zdani [ku]
    I see the [belief] blue house
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d4" name="e8d4">8.4)</a>   mi viska le blanu zdani ku .ia
    I see (the blue house ) [belief]
    I see what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>An attitudinal meant to cover a whole sentence can be attached to the preceding
    ``.i'', expressed or understood:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d5" name="e8d5">8.5)</a>  [.i] .ia mi viska le blanu zdani
    [belief] I see the blue house
    I believe I see a blue house.
</pre>or to an explicit ``vau'' placed at the end of a bridi.

    <p>Likewise, an attitudinal meant to cover a whole paragraph can be attached to
    ``ni'o'' or ``no'i''. An attitudinal at the beginning of a text applies to the whole
    text.</p>

    <p>However, sometimes it is necessary to be more specific about the range of one or
    more attitudinals, particularly if the range crosses the boundaries of standard
    Lojban syntactic constructions. The cmavo ``fu'e'' (of selma'o FUhE) and ``fu'o'' (of
    selma'o FUhO) provide explicit scope markers. Placing ``fu'e'' in front of an
    attitudinal disconnects it from what precedes it, and instead says that it applies to
    all following words until further notice. The notice is given by ``fu'o'', which can
    appear anywhere and cancels all in-force attitudinals. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e8d6" name="e8d6">8.6)</a>  mi viska le fu'e .ia blanu zdani fu'o ponse
    I see the [start] [belief] blue house [end] possessor
    I see the owner of what I believe to be a blue house.
</pre>

    <p>Here, only the ``blanu zdani'' portion of the three-part tanru ``blanu zdani
    ponse'' is marked as a belief of the speaker. Naturally, the attitudinal scope
    markers do not affect the rules for interpreting multi-part tanru: ``blanu zdani''
    groups first because tanru group from left to right unless overridden with ``ke'' or
    ``bo''.</p>

    <p>Other attitudinals of more local scope can appear after attitudinals marked by
    FUhE; these attitudinals are added to the globally active attitudinals rather than
    superseding them.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s9" name="s9">9. Quotations: LU, LIhU, LOhU, LEhU</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s9" name="s9">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s9" name="s9">   lu  LU  begin quotation
    li'u    LIhU    end quotation
    lo'u    LOhU    begin error quotation

</a>
</pre>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s9" name="s9">Grammatically, quotations are very simple in Lojban: all of
    them are sumti, and they all mean something like ``the piece of text here
    quoted'':</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s9" name="s9"></a><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e9d1" name=
"e9d1">9.1)</a>  mi pu cusku lu mi'e djan [li'u]
    I [past] express [quote] I-am John [unquote]
    I said, ``I'm John''.
</pre>

    <p>But in fact there are four different flavors of quotation in the language,
    involving six cmavo of six different selma'o. This being the case, quotation deserves
    some elaboration.</p>

    <p>The simplest kind of quotation, exhibited in <a href="#e9d1">Example 9.1</a>, uses
    the cmavo ``lu'' (of selma'o LU) as the opening quotation mark, and the cmavo
    ``li'u'' (of selma'o LIhU) as the closing quotation mark. The text between ``lu'' and
    ``li'u'' must be a valid, parseable Lojban text. If the quotation is ungrammatical,
    so is the surrounding expression. The cmavo ``li'u'' is technically an elidable
    terminator, but it's almost never possible to elide it except at the end of text.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``lo'u'' (of selma'o LOhU) and ``le'u'' (of selma'o LEhU) are used to
    surround a quotation that is not necessarily grammatical Lojban. However, the text
    must consist of morphologically correct Lojban words (as defined in <a href=
    "chapter4.html">Chapter 4</a>), so that the ``le'u'' can be picked out reliably. The
    words need not be meaningful, but they must be recognizable as cmavo, brivla, or
    cmene. Quotation with ``lo'u'' is essential to quoting ungrammatical Lojban for
    teaching in the language, the equivalent of the * that is used in English to mark
    such errors:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e9d2" name="e9d2">9.2)</a>  lo'u mi du do du la djan. le'u
        na tergerna la lojban.
    [quote] mi du do du la djan. [unquote]
        is-not a-grammatical-structure-in Lojban.
</pre><a href="#e9d2">Example 9.2</a> is grammatical even though the embedded quotation
is not. Similarly, ``lo'u'' quotation can quote fragments of a text which themselves do
not constitute grammatical utterances:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e9d3" name="e9d3">9.3)</a>  lu le mlatu cu viska le finpe li'u zo'u
        lo'u viska le le'u

        [quote] viska le [unquote]
        is-replaced-by [obligation!]
        [quote] viska lo [unquote].
    In the sentence ``le mlatu viska le finpe'',
        ``viska le'' should be replaced by ``viska lo''.
</pre>

    <p>Note the topic-comment formulation (<a href="#s4">Section 4</a>) and the indicator
    applying to the selbri only (<a href="#s8">Section 8</a>). Neither ``viska le'' nor
    ``viska lo'' is a valid Lojban utterance, and both require ``lo'u'' quotation.</p>

    <p>Additionally, pro-sumti or pro-bridi in the quoting sentence can refer to words
    appearing in the quoted sentence when ``lu ... li'u'' is used, but not when ``lo'u
    ... le'u'' is used:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e9d4" name="e9d4">9.4)</a>  la tcarlis. cusku lu le ninmu cu morsi li'u
        .iku'i ri jmive
    Charlie says [quote] the woman is-dead [unquote].
        However, the-last-mentioned is-alive.
    Charlie says ``The woman is dead'', but she is alive.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e9d4">Example 9.4</a>, ``ri'' is a pro-sumti which refers to the most
    recent previous sumti, namely ``le ninmu''. Compare:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e9d5" name="e9d5">9.5)</a>  la tcarlis. cusku lo'u le ninmu cu morsi le'u
        .iku'i ri jmive
    Charlie says [quote] le ninmu cu morsi [unquote].
        However, the-last-mentioned is-alive.
    Charlie says ``le ninmu cu morsi'', but he is alive.
</pre>In <a href="#e9d5">Example 9.5</a>, ``ri'' cannot refer to the referent of the
alleged sumti ``le ninmu'', because ``le ninmu cu morsi'' is a mere uninterpreted
sequence of Lojban words. Instead, ``ri'' ends up referring to the referent of the sumti
``la tcarlis.'', and so it is Charlie who is alive.

    <p>The metalinguistic erasers ``si'', ``sa'', and ``su'', discussed in <a href=
    "#s13">Section 13</a>, do not operate in text between ``lo'u'' and ``le'u''. Since
    the first ``le'u'' terminates a ``lo'u'' quotation, it is not directly possible to
    have a ``lo'u'' quotation within another ``lo'u'' quotation. However, it is possible
    for a ``le'u'' to occur within a ``lo'u ... le'u'' quotation by preceding it with the
    cmavo ``zo'', discussed in <a href="#s10">Section 10</a>. Note that ``le'u'' is not
    an elidable terminator; it is required.</p>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s10" name="s10">The following cmavo are discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s10" name="s10">   zo  ZO  quote single word
    zoi ZOI non-Lojban quotation
    la'o    ZOI non-Lojban name
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s10" name="s10">The cmavo ``zo'' (of selma'o ZO) is a strong quotation mark
for the single following word, which can be any Lojban word whatsoever. Among other uses,
``zo'' allows a metalinguistic word to be referenced without having it act on the
surrounding text. The word must be a morphologically legal (but not necessarily
meaningful) single Lojban word; compound cmavo are not permitted. For example:</a>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d1" name="e10d1">10.1)</a>    zo si cu lojbo valsi
    ``si'' is a Lojbanic word.
</pre>

    <p>Since ``zo'' acts on a single word only, there is no corresponding terminator.
    Brevity, then, is a great advantage of ``zo'', since the terminators for other kinds
    of quotation are rarely or never elidable.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``zoi'' (of selma'o ZOI) is a quotation mark for quoting unlexable
    (non-Lojban) text. Its syntax is ``zoi X. text .X'', where X is a Lojban word (called
    the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is
    not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream. It is common, but not
    required, to use the lerfu word (of selma'o BY) which corresponds to the Lojban name
    of the language being quoted:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d2" name="e10d2">10.2)</a>    zoi gy. John is a man .gy. cu glico jufra
    ``John is a man'' is an English sentence.
</pre>where ``gy'' stands for ``glico''. Other popular choices of delimiting words are
``.kuot.'', a Lojban name which sounds like the English word ``quote'', and the word
``zoi'' itself. Another possibility is a Lojban word suggesting the topic of the
quotation.

    <p>Within written text, the Lojban written word used as a delimiting word may not
    appear, whereas within spoken text, the sound of the delimiting word may not be
    uttered. This leads to occasional breakdowns of audio-visual isomorphism: <a href=
    "#e10d3">Example 10.3</a> is fine in speech but ungrammatical as written, whereas
    <a href="#e10d4">Example 10.4</a> is correct when written but ungrammatical in
    speech.</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d3" name="e10d3">10.3)</a>    ?mi djuno fi le valsi po'u zoi gy. gyrations .gy.
    I know about the word which-is ``gyrations''.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d4" name="e10d4">10.4)</a> ?mi djuno fi le valsi po'u zoi jai. gyrations .jai
    I know about the word which-is ``gyrations''.
</pre>

    <p>The text ``gy'' appears in the written word ``gyrations'', whereas the sound
    represented in Lojban by ``jai'' appears in the spoken word ``gyrations''. Such
    borderline cases should be avoided as a matter of good style.</p>

    <p>It should be noted particularly that ``zoi'' quotation is the only way to quote
    rafsi, specifically CCV rafsi, because they are not Lojban words, and ``zoi''
    quotation is the only way to quote things which are not Lojban words. (CVC and CVV
    rafsi look like names and cmavo respectively, and so can be quoted using other
    methods.) For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d5" name="e10d5">10.5)</a>    zoi ry. sku .ry. cu rafsi zo cusku
    ``sku'' is a rafsi of ``cusku''.
</pre>(A minor note on interaction between ``lo'u ... le'u'' and ``zoi'': The text
between ``lo'u'' and ``le'u'' should consist of Lojban words only. In fact, non-Lojban
material in the form of a ``zoi'' quotation may also appear. However, if the word
``le'u'' is used either as the delimiting word for the ``zoi'' quotation, or within the
quotation itself, the outer ``lo'u'' quotation will be prematurely terminated. Therefore,
``le'u'' should be avoided as the delimiting word in any ``zoi'' quotation.)

    <p>Lojban strictly avoids any confusion between things and the names of things:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d6" name="e10d6">10.6)</a>    zo .bab. cmene la bab.
    The-word ``Bob'' is-the-name-of the-one-named Bob.
</pre>In <a href="#e10d6">Example 10.6</a>, ``zo .bab.'' is the word, whereas ``la bab.''
is the thing named by the word. The cmavo ``la'e'' and ``lu'e'' (of selma'o LAhE) convert
back and forth between references and their referents:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d7" name="e10d7">10.7)</a>    zo .bab. cmene la'e zo .bab.
    The-word ``Bob'' is-the-name-of

    A-symbol-for Bob is-the-name-of Bob.
</pre><a href="#e10d6">Examples 10.6</a> through <a href="#e10d8">10.8</a> all mean
approximately the same thing, except for differences in emphasis. <a href=
"#e10d9">Example 10.9</a> is different:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d9" name="e10d9">10.9)</a>    la bab. cmene la bab.
    Bob is the name of Bob.
</pre>and says that Bob is both the name and the thing named, an unlikely situation.
People are not names.

    <p>(In <a href="#e10d6">Examples 10.6</a> through <a href="#e10d7">10.7</a>, the name
    ``bab.'' was separated from a preceding ``zo'' by a pause, thus: ``zo .bab.''. The
    reason for this extra pause is that all Lojban names must be separated by pause from
    any preceding word other than ``la'', ``lai'', ``la'i'' (all of selma'o LA) and
    ``doi'' (of selma'o DOI). There are numerous other cmavo that may precede a name: of
    these, ``zo'' is one of the most common.)</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``la'o'' also belongs to selma'o ZOI, and is mentioned here for
    completeness, although it does not signal the beginning of a quotation. Instead,
    ``la'o'' serves to mark non-Lojban names, especially the Linnaean binomial names
    (such as ``Homo sapiens'') which are the internationally standardized names for
    species of animals and plants. Internationally known names which can more easily be
    recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as ``Goethe'', can also appear
    in Lojban text with ``la'o'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e10d10" name=
"e10d10">10.10)</a>  la'o dy. Goethe .dy. cu me la'o ly. Homo sapiens .ly.
    Goethe is a Homo sapiens.
</pre>Using ``la'o'' for all names rather than Lojbanizing, however, makes for very
cumbersome text. A rough equivalent of ``la'o'' might be ``la me zoi''.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d2" name="e11d2">11.2)</a>    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>

    <p>The heavy stress on ``<i>George</i>'' (represented in writing by <i>italics</i>)
    indicates that I saw George rather than someone else. Lojban does not use stress in
    this way: stress is used only to help separate words (because every brivla is
    stressed on the penultimate syllable) and in names to match other languages' stress
    patterns. Note that many other languages do not use stress in this way either;
    typically word order is rearranged, producing something like</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d4" name="e11d4">11.4)</a>    It was George whom I saw.
</pre>In Lojban, the cmavo ``ba'e'' (of selma'o BAhE) precedes a single word which is to
be emphasized:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d4.5" name="e11d4.5">11.4.5)</a>    mi viska la ba'e .djordj.
    I saw the-one-named [emphasis] ``George''.
    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>

    <p>Note the pause before the name ``djordj.'', which serves to separate it
    unambiguously from the ``ba'e''. Alternatively, the ``ba'e'' can be moved to a
    position before the ``la'', which in effect emphasizes the whole construct ``la
    djordj.'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d5" name="e11d5">11.5)</a>    mi viska ba'e la djordj.
    I saw [emphasis] the-one-named ``George''.
    I saw <i>George</i>.
</pre>Marking a word with a cmavo of BAhE does not change the word's grammar in any way.
Any word in a bridi can receive contrastive emphasis marking:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d6" name="e11d6">11.6)</a>    ba'e mi viska la djordj.
    I, no one else, saw George.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d7" name="e11d7">11.7)</a> mi ba'e viska la djordj.
    I saw (not heard or smelled) George.
</pre>

    <p>Emphasis on one of the structural components of a Lojban bridi can also be
    achieved by rearranging it into an order that is not the speaker's or writer's usual
    order. Any sumti moved out of place, or the selbri when moved out of place, is
    emphatic to some degree.</p>

    <p>For completeness, the cmavo ``za'e'' should be mentioned, also of selma'o BAhE. It
    marks a word as possibly irregular, non-standard, or nonce (created for the
    occasion):</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e11d8" name="e11d8">11.8)</a>    mi klama la za'e. .albeinias
    I go-to so-called Albania
</pre>marks a Lojbanization of an English name, where a more appropriate standard form
might be something like ``la ctiipyris.'', reflecting the country's name in Albanian.

    <p>Before a lujvo or fu'ivla, ``za'e'' indicates that the word has been made up on
    the spot and may be used in a sense that is not found in the unabridged dictionary
    (when we have an unabridged dictionary!).</p>

(non-mathematical) parentheses, for inserting parenthetical remarks. Any text whatsoever
can go within the parentheses, and it is completely invisible to its context. It can,
however, refer to the context by the use of pro-sumti and pro-bridi: any that have been
assigned in the context are still assigned in the parenthetical remarks, but the reverse
is not true.</a>
    <pre>

</pre><a href="#e12d1">Example 12.1</a> implicitly redefines ``do'' within the
parentheses: the listener is changed by ``doi frank.'' When the context sentence resumes,
however, the old listener, Lisa, is automatically restored.

    <p>There is another cmavo of selma'o TO: ``to'i''. The difference between ``to'' and
    ``to'i'' is the difference between parentheses and square brackets in English prose.
    Remarks within ``to ... toi'' cmavo are implicitly by the same speaker, whereas
    remarks within ``to'i ... toi'' are implicitly by someone else, perhaps an
    editor:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d2" name="e12d2">12.2)</a>    la frank. cusku lu mi prami do
        to'isa'a do du la djein. toi li'u
    Frank expresses ``I love you
        [you = Jane]''
</pre>The ``sa'a'' suffix is a discursive cmavo (of selma'o UI) meaning ``editorial
insertion'', and indicating that the marked word or construct (in this case, the entire
bracketed remark) is not part of the quotation. It is required whenever the ``to'i ...
toi'' remark is physically within quotation marks, at least when speaking to
literal-minded listeners; the convention may be relaxed if no actual confusion results.

    <p>Note: The parser believes that parentheses are attached to the previous word or
    construct, because it treats them as syntactic equivalents of subscripts and other
    such so-called ``free modifiers''. Semantically, however, parenthetical remarks are
    not necessarily attached either to what precedes them or what follows them.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``sei'' (of selma'o SEI) begins an embedded discursive bridi. Comments
    added with ``sei'' are called ``metalinguistic'', because they are comments about the
    discourse itself rather than about the subject matter of the discourse. This sense of
    the term ``metalinguistic'' is used throughout this chapter, and is not to be
    confused with the sense ``language for expressing other languages''.</p>

    <p>When marked with ``sei'', a metalinguistic utterance can be embedded in another
    utterance as a discursive. In this way, discursives which do not have cmavo assigned
    in selma'o UI can be expressed:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d3" name="e12d3">12.3)</a>    la frank. prami sei la frank. gleki la djein.
    Frank loves (Frank is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>Using the happiness attitudinal, ``.ui'', would imply that the speaker was happy.
    Instead, the speaker attributes happiness to Frank. It would probably be safe to
    elide the one who is happy, and say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d4" name="e12d4">12.4)</a>    la frank. prami sei gleki la djein.
    Frank loves (he is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>The grammar of the bridi following ``sei'' has an unusual limitation: the sumti
    must either all precede the selbri, or must be glued into the selbri with ``be'' and
    ``bei'':</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d5" name=
"e12d5">12.5)</a>    la frank. prami sei gleki be fa la suzn. la djein.
    Frank loves (Susan is happy) Jane.
</pre>

    <p>This restriction allows the terminator cmavo ``se'u'' to almost always be
    elided.</p>

    <p>Since a discursive utterance is working at a ``higher'' level of abstraction than
    a non-discursive utterance, a non-discursive utterance cannot refer to a discursive
    utterance. Specifically, the various back-counting, reciprocal, and reflexive
    constructs in selma'o KOhA ignore the utterances at ``higher'' metalinguistic levels
    in determining their referent. It is possible, and sometimes necessary, to refer to
    lower metalinguistic levels. For example, the English ``he said'' in a conversation
    is metalinguistic. For this purpose, quotations are considered to be at a lower
    metalinguistic level than the surrounding context (a quoted text cannot refer to the
    statements of the one who quotes it), whereas parenthetical remarks are considered to
    be at a higher level than the context.</p>

    <p>Lojban works differently from English in that the ``he said'' can be marked
    instead of the quotation. In Lojban, you can say:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d6" name="e12d6">12.6)</a>    la djan. cusku lu mi klama le zarci li'u
    John expresses ``I go to-the store''.
</pre>which literally claims that John uttered the quoted text. If the central claim is
that John made the utterance, as is likely in conversation, this style is the most
sensible. However, in written text which quotes a conversation, you don't want the ``he
said'' or ``she said'' to be considered part of the conversation. If unmarked, it could
mess up the anaphora counting. Instead, you can use:
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d7" name="e12d7">12.7)</a>    lu mi klama le zarci
        seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei li'u
    `` I go to-the store
        ( John expresses this-sentence ) ''
    ``I go to the store'', said John.
</pre>

    <p>And of course other orders are possible:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d8" name=
"e12d8">12.8)</a>    lu seisa'a la djan. cusku be dei mi klama le zarci
    John said, ``I go to the store''.

<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e12d9" name="e12d9">12.9)</a> lu mi klama seisa'a la djan cusku le zarci
    ``I go'', John said, ``to the store''.
</pre>

    <p>Note the ``sa'a'' following each ``sei'', marking the ``sei'' and its attached
    bridi as an editorial insert, not part of the quotation. In a more relaxed style,
    these ``sa'a'' cmavo would probably be dropped.</p>

    <p>The elidable terminator for ``sei'' is ``se'u'' (of selma'o SEhU); it is rarely
    needed, except to separate a selbri within the ``sei'' comment from an immediately
    following selbri (or component) outside the comment.</p>

    delimiting word. The next word must be different from the delimiting word, and
    ``gy.'', the Lojban name for the letter ``g'', was chosen arbitrarily. Then the
    delimiting word must be repeated. For purposes of ``si'' erasure, the entire quoted
    text is taken to be a word, so four words have been uttered, and four more ``si''
    cmavo are needed to erase them altogether. Similarly, a stray ``lo'u'' quotation mark
    must be erased with ``fy. le'u si si si'', by completing the quotation and then
    erasing it all with three ``si'' cmavo.</p>

    <p>What if less than the entire ``zo'' or ``zoi'' construct is erased? The result is
    something which has a loose ``zo'' or ``zoi'' in it, without its expected sequels,
    and which is incurably ungrammatical. Thus, to erase just the word quoted by ``zo'',
    it turns out to be necessary to erase the ``zo'' as well:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e13d6" name="e13d6">13.6)</a>    mi se cmene zo .djan.
        si si zo .djordj.
    I am-named-by the-word ``John'',
        er, er, the-word ``George''.
</pre>

    <p>The parser will reject ``zo .djan. si .djordj.'', because in that context
    ``djordj.'' is a name (of selma'o CMENE) rather than a quoted word.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement ``si'' erasure.</p>

    <p>As the above examples plainly show, precise erasures with ``si'' can be extremely
    hard to get right. Therefore, the cmavo ``sa'' (of selma'o SA) is provided for
    erasing more than one word. The cmavo following ``sa'' should be the starting marker
    of some grammatical construct. The effect of the ``sa'' is to erase back to and
    including the last starting marker of the same kind. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e13d7" name="e13d7">13.7)</a>    mi viska le sa .i mi cusku zo .djan.
    I see the  ...  I say the-word ``John''.
</pre>

    <p>Since the word following ``sa'' is ``.i'', the sentence separator, its effect is
    to erase the preceding sentence. So <a href="#e13d7">Example 13.7</a> is equivalent
    to:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e13d8" name="e13d8">13.8)</a>    mi cusku zo .djan.
</pre>

    <p>Another example, erasing a partial description rather than a partial sentence:</p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-e13d9" name="e13d9">13.9)</a>    mi viska le blanu zdan. sa le xekri zdani
    I see the blue hou ...  the black house.
</pre>

    <p>In <a href="#e13d9">Example 13.9</a>, ``le blanu zdan.'' is ungrammatical, but
    clearly reflects the speaker's original intention to say ``le blanu zdani''. However,
    the ``zdani'' was cut off before the end and changed into a name. The entire
    ungrammatical ``le'' construct is erased and replaced by ``le xekri zdani''.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement ``sa'' erasure. Getting ``sa''
    right is even more difficult (for a computer) than getting ``si'' right, as the
    behavior of ``si'' is defined in terms of words rather than in terms of grammatical
    constructs (possibly incorrect ones) and words are conceptually simpler entities. On
    the other hand, ``sa'' is generally easier for human beings, because the rules for
    using it correctly are less finicky.</p>

    <p>The cmavo ``su'' (of selma'o SU) is yet another metalinguistic operator that
    erases the entire text. However, if the text involves multiple speakers, then ``su''
    will only erase the remarks made by the one who said it, unless that speaker has said
    nothing. Therefore ``susu'' is needed to eradicate a whole discussion in
    conversation.</p>

    <p>Note: The current machine parser does not implement either ``su'' or ``susu''
    erasure.</p>

    <h2><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s14" name="s14">14. Hesitation: Y</a></h2>

    <p><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s14" name="s14">The following cmavo is discussed in this section:</a></p>
    <pre>
<a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s14" name="s14">   .y. Y   hesitation noise
</a>
</pre><a id="reference-grammar-chapter-19-s14" name="s14">Speakers often need to hesitate to think of what to say next
or for some extra-linguistic reason. There are two ways to hesitate in Lojban: to pause
between words (that is, to say nothing) or to use the cmavo ``.y.'' (of selma'o Y). This
resembles in sound the English hesitation noise written ``uh'' (or ``er''), but differs
from it in the requirement for pauses before and after. Unlike a long pause, it cannot be
mistaken for having nothing more to say: it holds the floor for the speaker. Since vowel
length is not significant in Lojban, the ``y'' sound can be dragged out for as long as
necessary. Furthermore, the sound can be repeated, provided the required pauses are
respected.</a>

    <p>Since the hesitation sound in English is outside the formal language,
    English-speakers may question the need for a formal cmavo. Speakers of other
    languages, however, often hesitate by saying (or, if necessary, repeating) a word
    (``este'' in some dialects of Spanish, roughly meaning ``that is''), and Lojban's
    audio-visual isomorphism requires a written representation of all meaningful spoken
    behavior. Of course, ``.y.'' has no grammatical significance: it can appear anywhere
    at all in a Lojban sentence except in the middle of a word.</p>

outside the regular grammar, and the machine parser takes it as an unconditional signal
to stop parsing unless it is quoted with ``zo'' or with ``lo'u ... le'u''. In particular,
it is not used at the end of subordinate texts quoted with ``lu ... li'u'' or

      <h5>$Revision: 4.3 $<br />
      mkhtml: 1.1</h5>
      -->
    </div>

    <p>The following paragraphs list all the selma'o of Lojban, with a brief explanation
    of what each one is about, and reference to the chapter number where each is
    explained more fully. As usual, all selma'o names are given in capital letters (with
    ``h'' serving as the capital of ``''') and are the names of a representative cmavo,
    often the most important or the first in alphabetical order. One example is given of
    each selma'o: for selma'o which have several uses, the most common use is shown.</p>

    <p>selma'o A (<a href="chapter14.html">Chapter 14</a>)</p>

    <p>Specifies a logical connection (e.g. ``and'', ``or'', ``if''), usually between
    sumti.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>la djan. .a la djein. klama le zarci John and/or Jane goes to the store.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Also used to create vowel lerfu words when followed with ``bu''.</p>

    <p>selma'o BAI (<a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>)</p>

    <p>May be prefixed to a sumti to specify an additional place, not otherwise present
    in the place structure of the selbri, and derived from a single place of some other
    selbri.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>mi tavla bau la lojban. I speak in-language Lojban.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o BAhE (<a href="chapter19.html">Chapter 19</a>)

      who goes to the store.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o BE (<a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>)

    <p>Attaches sumti which fill the place structure of a single unit making up a tanru.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the sumti fill the x2, x3, and successive places in that
    order. BE is most useful in descriptions formed with LE. See BEI, BEhO.</p>

    <dl>

      four-and two.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o BU (<a href="chapter17.html">Chapter 17</a>)

    <p>A suffix which can be attached to any word, typically a word representing a letter
    of the alphabet or else a name, to make a word for a symbol or a different letter of
    the alphabet. In particular, attached to single-vowel cmavo to make words for vowel
    letters.</p>

      go to the market.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o CAhA (<a href="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</a>)

    <p>Specifies whether a bridi refers to an actual fact, a potential (achieved or not),
    or merely an innate capability.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>ro datka ka'e flulimna all ducks [capability] are-float-swimmers All ducks have
      the capability of swimming by floating.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o CEI (<a href="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</a>)

    <p>Assigns a selbri definition to one of the five pro-bridi gismu: ``broda'',

    </dl>selma'o CO (<a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</a>)

    <p>When inserted between the components of a tanru, inverts it, so that the following
    tanru unit modifies the previous one.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>mi troci co klama le zarci le zdani I am-a-trier of-type (goer to-the market

    </dl>selma'o COI (<a href="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</a>, <a href=
    "chapter13.html">Chapter 13</a>)

    <p>When prefixed to a name, description, or sumti, produces a vocative: a phrase
    which indicates who is being spoken to (or who is speaking). Vocatives are used in
    conversational protocols, including greeting, farewell, and radio communication. See
    DOI, DOhU.</p>

    <dl>
      <dd>coi .djan. Greetings, John.</dd>
    </dl>selma'o CU (<a href="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</a>)

    <p>Separates the selbri of a bridi from any sumti which precede it. Never strictly
    necessary, but often useful to eliminate various elidable terminators.</p>

    <dl>

    <p>The following two listings constitute the formal grammar of Lojban. The first
    version is written in the YACC language, which is used to describe parsers, and has
    been used to create a parser for Lojban texts. This parser is available from the
    Logical Language Group. The second listing is in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and
    represents the same grammar in a more human-readable form. (In case of discrepancies,
    the YACC version is official.) There is a cross-reference listing for the EBNF format
    that shows, for each selma'o and rule, which rules refer to it.</p>

    <p>/* The Lojban machine parsing algorithm is a multi-step process. The YACC machine
    grammar presented here is an amalgam of those steps, concatenated so as to allow YACC
    to verify the syntactic ambiguity of the grammar. YACC is used to generate a parser
    for a portion of the grammar, which is LALR1 (the type of grammar that YACC is
    designed to identify and process successfully), but most of the rest of the grammar
    must be parsed using some language-coded processing.</p>

    <h3>Step 1 - Lexing</h3>

    <p>From phonemes, stress, and pause, it is possible to resolve Lojban unambiguously
    into a stream of words. Any machine processing of speech will have to have some way
    to deal with 'non-Lojban' failures of fluent speech, of course. The resolved words
    can be expressed as a text file, using Lojban's phonetic spelling rules.</p>

    <p>The following steps, assume that there is the possibility of non-Lojban text
    within the Lojban text (delimited appropriately). Such non-Lojban text may not be
    reducible from speech phonetically. However, step 2 allows the filtering of a
    phonetically transcribed text stream, to recognize such portions of non-Lojban text
    where properly delimited, without interference with the parsing algorithm.</p>

    <h3>Step 2 - Filtering</h3>

    <p>From start to end, performing the following filtering and lexing tasks using the
    given order of precedence in case of conflict:</p>

    <p>a. If the Lojban word ``zoi'' (selma'o ZOI) is identified, take the following
    Lojban word (which should be end delimited with a pause for separation from the
    following non-Lojban text) as an opening delimiter. Treat all text following that
    delimiter, until that delimiter recurs *after a pause*, as grammatically a single
    token (labelled '<a href="#y699">anything_699</a>' in this grammar). There is no need
    for processing within this text except as necessary to find the closing
    delimiter.</p>

    <p>b. If the Lojban word ``zo'' (selma'o ZO) is identified, treat the following
    Lojban word as a token labelled '<a href="#y698">any_word_698</a>', instead of lexing
    it by its normal grammatical function.</p>

    <p>c. If the Lojban word ``lo'u'' (selma'o LOhU) is identified, search for the
    closing delimiter ``le'u'' (selma'o LEhU), ignoring any such closing delimiters
    absorbed by the previous two steps. The text between the delimiters should be treated
    as the single token '<a href="#y697">any_words_697</a>'.</p>

    <p>d. Categorize all remaining words into their Lojban selma'o category, including
    the various delimiters mentioned in the previous steps. In all steps after step 2,
    only the selma'o token type is significant for each word.</p>

    <p>e. If the word ``si'' (selma'o SI) is identified, erase it and the previous word
    (or token, if the previous text has been condensed into a single token by one of the
    above rules).</p>

    <p>f. If the word ``sa'' (selma'o SA) is identified, erase it and all preceding text
    as far back as necessary to make what follows attach to what precedes. (This rule is
    hard to formalize and may receive further definition later.)</p>

    <p>g. If the word 'su' (selma'o SU) is identified, erase it and all preceding text
    back to and including the first preceding token word which is in one of the selma'o:
    NIhO, LU, TUhE, and TO. However, if speaker identification is available, a SU shall
    only erase to the beginning of a speaker's discourse, unless it occurs at the
    beginning of a speaker's discourse. (Thus, if the speaker has said something, two
    ``su'''s are required to erase the entire conversation.</p>

    <h3>Step 3 - Termination</h3>

    <p>If the text contains a FAhO, treat that as the end-of-text and ignore everything
    that follows it.</p>

    <h3>Step 4 - Absorption of Grammar-Free Tokens</h3>

    <p>In a new pass, perform the following absorptions (absorption means that the token
    is removed from the grammar for processing in following steps, and optionally
    reinserted, grouped with the absorbing token after parsing is completed).</p>

    <p>a. Token sequences of the form any - (ZEI - any) ..., where there may be any
    number of ZEIs, are merged into a single token of selma'o BRIVLA.</p>

    <p>b. Absorb all selma'o BAhE tokens into the following token. If they occur at the
    end of text, leave them alone (they are errors).</p>

    <p>c. Absorb all selma'o BU tokens into the previous token. Relabel the previous
    token as selma'o BY.</p>

    <p>d. If selma'o NAI occurs immediately following any of tokens UI or CAI, absorb the
    NAI into the previous token.</p>

    <p>e. Absorb all members of selma'o DAhO, FUhO, FUhE, UI, Y, and CAI into the
    previous token. All of these null grammar tokens are permitted following any word of
    the grammar, without interfering with that word's grammatical function, or causing
    any effect on the grammatical interpretation of any other token in the text.
    Indicators at the beginning of text are explicitly handled by the grammar.</p>

    <h3>Step 5 - Insertion of Lexer Lexemes</h3>

    <p>Lojban is not in itself LALR1. There are words whose grammatical function is
    determined by following tokens. As a result, parsing of the YACC grammar must take
    place in two steps. In the first step, certain strings of tokens with defined
    grammars are identified, and either</p>

    <p>a. are replaced by a single specified 'lexer token' for step 6, or</p>

    <p>b. the lexer token is inserted in front of the token string to identify it
    uniquely.</p>

    <p>The YACC grammar included herein is written to make YACC generation of a step 6
    parser easy regardless of whether a. or b. is used. The strings of tokens to be
    labelled with lexer tokens are found in rule terminals labelled with numbers between
    900 and 1099. These rules are defined with the lexer tokens inserted, with the result
    that it can be verified that the language is LALR1 under option b. after steps 1
    through 4 have been performed. Alternatively, if option a. is to be used, these rules
    are commented out, and the rule terminals labelled from 800 to 900 refer to the lexer
    tokens *without* the strings of defining tokens. Two sets of lexer tokens are defined
    in the token set so as to be compatible with either option.</p>

    <p>In this step, the strings must be labelled with the appropriate lexer tokens.
    Order of inserting lexer tokens *IS* significant, since some shorter strings that
    would be marked with a lexer token may be found inside longer strings. If the tokens
    are inserted before or in place of the shorter strings, the longer strings cannot be
    identified.</p>

    <p>If option a. is chosen, the following order of insertion works correctly (it is
    not the only possible order): A, C, D, B, U, E, H, I, J, K, M ,N, G, O, V, W, F, P,
    R, T, S, Y, L, Q. This ensures that the longest rules will be processed first; a
    PA+MAI will not be seen as a PA with a dangling MAI at the end, for example.</p>

    <h3>Step 6 - YACC Parsing</h3>

    <p>YACC should now be able to parse the Lojban text in accordance with the rule
    terminals labelled from 1 to 899 under option 5a, or 1 to 1099 under option 5b.
    Comment out the rules beyond 900 if option 5a is used, and comment out the 700-series
    of lexer-tokens, while restoring the series of lexer tokens numbered from 900 up.</p>

   this purpose, we will cheat on the use of ZO in such a quote (since this
   is ungrammatical text, it is a sign ignored by the parser).  Use ZO to
   mark any nested quotation LOhU.  The preparser then will absorb it by
   the ZO rule, before testing for LOhU.  This is obviously not the
   standard usage for ZO, which would otherwise cause the result to be a
   sumti.  But, since the result will be part of an unparsed string anyway,

/* It may be seen that any of the ZO/ZOI/LOhU trio of quotation markers
   may contain the powerful metalinguistic erasers.  Since these quotations
   are not parsed internally, these operators are ignored within the quote.
   To erase a ZO, then, two SI's are needed after giving a quoted word of
   any type.  ZOI takes four SI's, with the ENTIRE BODY OF THE QUOTE
   treated as a single 'word' since it is one selma'o.  Thus one for the
   quote body, two for the single word delimiters, and one for the ZOI.  In
   LOhU, the entire body is treated as a single word, so three SI's can
   erase it.  */

/* All rule terminator names with 'gap' in them are potentially

/* The following are ``Lexer-only rules'', covered by steps 1-4 described

   except possibly in cases where they interact with each other.  Even
   there, however, the effects are semantic rather than grammatical.  Where
   it is believed possible that conflicts could exist, the grammar of these
   constructs has been put in the above grammar, even though the
   lexer/Preparser will actually prevent these from being passed thru to
   the parse routine.  (Otherwise we have to put unacceptably fancy code in
   the PreParser to determine just when these can be passed thru, and when
   they can't.)  Constructs in this category include quotes and indicators
   as defined above.  (The above grammar handles utterance scope
   (free_modifier) and clause scope (gap) applications of the latter,
   however, and indicators should be allowed to be absorbed into almost any
   word without changing its grammar.

    "s2">Lojban Machine Grammar, EBNF Version, 3rd Baseline as of 10 January 1997</a>

    <p>This document is explicitly dedicated to the public domain by its author, the
    Logical Language Group Inc. Contact that organization at: 2904 Beau Lane, Fairfax VA
    22031 USA 703-385-0273 (intl: +1 703 385 0273)</p>

    <p>Explanation of notation: All rules have the form:</p>

    <div class="c2">
      name<sub>number</sub> = bnf-expression
    </div><br />
    <br />
    which means that the grammatical construct ``name'' is defined by ``bnf-expression''.
    The number cross-references this grammar with the rule numbers in the YACC grammar.
    The names are the same as those in the YACC grammar, except that subrules are labeled
    with A, B, C, ... in the YACC grammar and with 1, 2, 3, ... in this grammar. In
    addition, rule 971 is ``simple_tag'' in the YACC grammar but ``stag'' in this
    grammar, because of its frequent appearance.

    <ol>
      <li>Names in lower case are grammatical constructs.</li>

      <li>Names in UPPER CASE are selma'o (lexeme) names, and are terminals.</li>

      <li>Concatenation is expressed by juxtaposition with no operator symbol.</li>

      <li>| represents alternation (choice).</li>

      <li>[] represents an optional element.</li>

      <li>&amp; represents and/or (``A &amp; B'' is the same as ``A | B | A B'').</li>

      <li>... represents optional repetition of the construct to the left. Left-grouping
      is implied; right-grouping is shown by explicit self-referential recursion with no
      ``...''</li>

      <li>() serves to indicate the grouping of the other operators. Otherwise, ``...''
      binds closer than &amp;, which binds closer than |.</li>

      <li># is shorthand for ``[free ...]'', a construct which appears in many
      places.</li>

      <li>// encloses an elidable terminator, which may be omitted (without change of
      meaning) if no grammatical ambiguity results.</li>
    </ol>
